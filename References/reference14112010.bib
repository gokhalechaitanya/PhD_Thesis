@article{sigmund:2010aa,
	Abstract = {Theoretical and empirical research highlights the role of punishment in promoting collaborative efforts. However, both the emergence and the stability of costly punishment are problematic issues. It is not clear how punishers can invade a society of defectors by social learning or natural selection, or how second-order free-riders (who contribute to the joint effort but not to the sanctions) can be prevented from drifting into a coercion-based regime and subverting cooperation. Here we compare the prevailing model of peer-punishment with pool-punishment, which consists in committing resources, before the collaborative effort, to prepare sanctions against free-riders. Pool-punishment facilitates the sanctioning of second-order free-riders, because these are exposed even if everyone contributes to the common good. In the absence of such second-order punishment, peer-punishers do better than pool-punishers; but with second-order punishment, the situation is reversed. Efficiency is traded for stability. Neither other-regarding tendencies or preferences for reciprocity and equity, nor group selection or prescriptions from higher authorities, are necessary for the emergence and stability of rudimentary forms of sanctioning institutions regulating common pool resources and enforcing collaborative efforts.},

	Abstract = {Microorganisms have been mutating and evolving on Earth for billions of years. Now, a field of research has developed around the idea of using microorganisms to study evolution in action. Controlled and replicated experiments are using viruses, bacteria and yeast to investigate how their genomes and phenotypic properties evolve over hundreds and even thousands of generations. Here, we examine the dynamics of evolutionary adaptation, the genetic bases of adaptation, tradeoffs and the environmental specificity of adaptation, the origin and evolutionary consequences of mutators, and the process of drift decay in very small populations.},

	Abstract = {Evolutionary game dynamics describes the spreading of successful strategies
	in a population of reproducing individuals. Typically, the microscopic
	definition of strategy spreading is stochastic such that the dynamics
	becomes deterministic only in infinitely large populations. Here,
	we present a microscopic birth-death process that has a fully deterministic
	strong selection limit in well-mixed populations of any size. Additionally,
	under weak selection, from this process the frequency-dependent Moran
	process is recovered. This makes it a natural extension of the usual
	evolutionary dynamics under weak selection. We find simple expressions
	for the fixation probabilities and average fixation times of the
	process in evolutionary games with two players and two strategies.
	For cyclic games with two players and three strategies, we show that
	the resulting deterministic dynamics crucially depends on the initial
	condition in a nontrivial way.},

	condition whenever any telomere reaches the critical length. Using

	are equally likely to interact. In particular we consider the average
	abundances of two strategies, A and B, under mutation and selection.
	The game dynamical interaction between the two strategies is given
	by the 2x2 payoff matrix (acbd). It has previously been shown that
	A is more abundant than B, if a(N-2)+bN>cN+d(N-2). This result has

	Abstract = {Bet hedging-stochastic switching between phenotypic states-is a canonical
	example of an evolutionary adaptation that facilitates persistence
	in the face of fluctuating environmental conditions. Although bet
	hedging is found in organisms ranging from bacteria to humans, direct
	evidence for an adaptive origin of this behaviour is lacking. Here
	we report the de novo evolution of bet hedging in experimental bacterial
	populations. Bacteria were subjected to an environment that continually
	favoured new phenotypic states. Initially, our regime drove the successive
	evolution of novel phenotypes by mutation and selection; however,
	in two (of 12) replicates this trend was broken by the evolution
	of bet-hedging genotypes that persisted because of rapid stochastic
	phenotype switching. Genome re-sequencing of one of these switching
	types revealed nine mutations that distinguished it from the ancestor.
	The final mutation was both necessary and sufficient for rapid phenotype
	switching; nonetheless, the evolution of bet hedging was contingent
	upon earlier mutations that altered the relative fitness effect of
	the final mutation. These findings capture the adaptive evolution
	of bet hedging in the simplest of organisms, and suggest that risk-spreading
	strategies may have been among the earliest evolutionary solutions
	to life in fluctuating environments.},

	Abstract = {Cancer results from genetic alterations that disturb the normal cooperative
	behavior of cells. Recent high-throughput genomic studies of cancer
	cells have shown that the mutational landscape of cancer is complex
	and that individual cancers may evolve through mutations in as many
	as 20 different cancer-associated genes. We use data published by
	Sjoblom et al. (2006) to develop a new mathematical model for the
	somatic evolution of colorectal cancers. We employ the Wright-Fisher
	process for exploring the basic parameters of this evolutionary process
	and derive an analytical approximation for the expected waiting time
	to the cancer phenotype. Our results highlight the relative importance
	of selection over both the size of the cell population at risk and
	the mutation rate. The model predicts that the observed genetic diversity
	of cancer genomes can arise under a normal mutation rate if the average
	selective advantage per mutation is on the order of 1%. Increased
	mutation rates due to genetic instability would allow even smaller
	selective advantages during tumorigenesis. The complexity of cancer
	progression can be understood as the result of multiple sequential
	mutations, each of which has a relatively small but positive effect

@article{Beerenwinkel:2007qy,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Understanding interactions between mutations and how they
	affect fitness is a central problem in evolutionary biology that
	bears on such fundamental issues as the structure of fitness landscapes
	and the evolution of sex. To date, analyses of fitness landscapes
	have focused either on the overall directional curvature of the fitness
	landscape or on the distribution of pairwise interactions. In this
	paper, we propose and employ a new mathematical approach that allows
	a more complete description of multi-way interactions and provides
	new insights into the structure of fitness landscapes. RESULTS: We
	apply the mathematical theory of gene interactions developed by Beerenwinkel
	et al. to a fitness landscape for Escherichia coli obtained by Elena
	and Lenski. The genotypes were constructed by introducing nine mutations
	into a wild-type strain and constructing a restricted set of 27 double
	mutants. Despite the absence of mutants higher than second order,
	our analysis of this genotypic space points to previously unappreciated
	gene interactions, in addition to the standard pairwise epistasis.
	Our analysis confirms Elena and Lenski's inference that the fitness
	landscape is complex, so that an overall measure of curvature obscures
	a diversity of interaction types. We also demonstrate that some mutations
	contribute disproportionately to this complexity. In particular,
	some mutations are systematically better than others at mixing with
	other mutations. We also find a strong correlation between epistasis
	and the average fitness loss caused by deleterious mutations. In
	particular, the epistatic deviations from multiplicative expectations
	tend toward more positive values in the context of more deleterious
	mutations, emphasizing that pairwise epistasis is a local property
	of the fitness landscape. Finally, we determine the geometry of the
	fitness landscape, which reflects many of these biologically interesting
	features. CONCLUSION: A full description of complex fitness landscapes
	requires more information than the average curvature or the distribution
	of independent pairwise interactions. We have proposed a mathematical
	approach that, in principle, allows a complete description and, in
	practice, can suggest new insights into the structure of real fitness
	landscapes. Our analysis emphasizes the value of non-independent
	genotypes for these inferences.},

	Abstract = {Humanity has just crossed a major landmark in its history with the
	majority of people now living in cities. Cities have long been known
	to be society's predominant engine of innovation and wealth creation,
	yet they are also its main source of crime, pollution, and disease.
	The inexorable trend toward urbanization worldwide presents an urgent
	challenge for developing a predictive, quantitative theory of urban
	organization and sustainable development. Here we present empirical
	evidence indicating that the processes relating urbanization to economic
	development and knowledge creation are very general, being shared
	by all cities belonging to the same urban system and sustained across
	different nations and times. Many diverse properties of cities from
	patent production and personal income to electrical cable length
	are shown to be power law functions of population size with scaling
	exponents, beta, that fall into distinct universality classes. Quantities
	reflecting wealth creation and innovation have beta approximately
	1.2 >1 (increasing returns), whereas those accounting for infrastructure
	display beta approximately 0.8 <1 (economies of scale). We predict
	that the pace of social life in the city increases with population
	size, in quantitative agreement with data, and we discuss how cities
	are similar to, and differ from, biological organisms, for which
	beta<1. Finally, we explore possible consequences of these scaling
	relations by deriving growth equations, which quantify the dramatic
	difference between growth fueled by innovation versus that driven
	by economies of scale. This difference suggests that, as population
	grows, major innovation cycles must be generated at a continually
	accelerating rate to sustain growth and avoid stagnation or collapse.},

	Abstract = {Kin and levels-of-selection models are common approaches for modelling
	social evolution. Indirect genetic effect (IGE) models represent
	a different approach, specifying social effects on trait values rather
	than fitness. We investigate the joint effect of relatedness, multilevel
	selection and IGEs on response to selection. We present a measure
	for the degree of multilevel selection, which is the natural partner
	of relatedness in expressions for response. Response depends on both
	relatedness and the degree of multilevel selection, rather than only
	one or the other factor. Moreover, response is symmetric in relatedness
	and the degree of multilevel selection, indicating that both factors
	have exactly the same effect. Without IGEs, the key parameter is
	the product of relatedness and the degree of multilevel selection.
	With IGEs, however, multilevel selection without relatedness can
	explain evolution of social traits. Thus, next to relatedness and
	multilevel selection, IGEs are a key element in the genetical theory
	of social evolution.},

	Emergence of cooperation and evolutionary stability in finite populations.
	Nature 428, 246-650] describes a robustness criterion for evolution
	in a finite population: If at an A-frequency of 1/3, the fitness
	of an A player is greater (smaller) than the fitness of a B player,
	then a single A mutant that appears in a population of otherwise
	all B has a fixation probability greater (smaller) than the neutral

	at an A-frequency of 1/3, the fitness of an A player is exactly equal
	to the fitness of a B player. We find that in this case the relative
	magnitude of the cross payoffs matters: If the payoff of A against
	B is larger (smaller) than the payoff of B against A, then a single
	A mutant has a fixation probability larger (smaller) than 1/N. If
	the cross payoffs coincide, we are in the special case of a partnership
	game, where the deviation cost from an inefficient equilibrium is
	exactly balanced by the potential gain of switching to the payoff
	dominant equilibrium. We show that in this case the fixation probability
	of A is lower than 1/N. Finally, we illustrate our findings by a
	language game with differentiated costs of signals.},

	Abstract = {The genes encoding major histocompatibility (MHC) molecules are among
	the most polymorphic genes known for vertebrates. Since MHC molecules
	play an important role in the induction of immune responses, the
	evolution of MHC polymorphism is often explained in terms of increased
	protection of hosts against pathogens. Two selective pressures that
	are thought to be involved are (1) selection favoring MHC heterozygous
	hosts, and (2) selection for rare MHC alleles by host-pathogen coevolution.
	We have developed a computer simulation of coevolving hosts and pathogens
	to study the relative impact of these two mechanisms on the evolution
	of MHC polymorphism. We found that heterozygote advantage per se
	is insufficient to explain the high degree of polymorphism at the
	MHC, even in very large host populations. Host-pathogen coevolution,
	on the other hand, can easily account for realistic polymorphisms
	of more than 50 alleles per MHC locus. Since evolving pathogens mainly
	evade presentation by the most common MHC alleles in the host population,
	they provide a selective pressure for a large variety of rare MHC
	alleles. Provided that the host population is sufficiently large,
	a large set of MHC alleles can persist over many host generations
	under host-pathogen coevolution, despite the fact that allele frequencies
	continuously change.},

	Abstract = {The puzzle of the emergence of cooperation between unrelated individuals
	is shared across diverse fields of behavioural sciences and economics.
	In this article we combine the public goods game originating in economics
	with evolutionary approaches traditionally used in biology. Instead
	of pairwise encounters, we consider the more complex case of groups
	of three interacting individuals. We show that territoriality is
	capable of promoting cooperative behaviour, as in the case of the
	Prisoner's Dilemma. Moreover, by adding punishment opportunities,
	the readiness to cooperate is greatly enhanced and asocial strategies
	can be largely suppressed. Finally, as soon as players carry a reputation
	for being willing or unwilling to punish, highly cooperative and
	fair outcomes are achieved. This group-beneficial result is obtained,
	intriguingly, by making individuals more likely to exploit their
	co-players if they can get away with it. Thus, less-cooperative individuals
	make more-cooperative societies.},

	Abstract = {In families with X-linked chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), heterozygous
	females have two stable populations of polymorphonuclear leukocytes
	(PMN) in their blood; one normal, the other, deficient in oxygen
	metabolism. The two types of PMN can be distinguished by the ability
	or lack of ability to reduce nitroblue tetrazolium dye. The variation
	in the percent normal PMN among 11 CGD heterozygotes was shown to
	follow a binomial distribution based on eight independent trials
	and a chance of success of 50%. This is consistent with the occurrence
	of X-chromosome inactivation (lyonization) when eight embryonic founder
	cells for the hematopoietic system are present. Serial determinations
	of the percent normal PMN in individual heterozygotes showed very
	limited variability (standard deviations ranged from 2.0% to 5.2%)
	most of which could be ascribed to experimental error. An estimate
	of the remaining variation (residual variance) was introduced into
	a well-known formula to calculate the appropriate number of pluripotent
	stem cells necessary to support hematopoiesis and a figure exceeding
	400 was obtained. Thus, the data indicate that in humans there is
	a highly polyclonal system of hematopoiesis.},

	Abstract = {The canonical model in economics considers people to be rational and
	self-regarding. However, much evidence challenges this view, raising
	the question of when "Economic Man" dominates the outcome of social
	interactions, and when bounded rationality or other-regarding preferences
	dominate. Here we show that strategic incentives are the key to answering
	this question. A minority of self-regarding individuals can trigger
	a "noncooperative" aggregate outcome if their behavior generates
	incentives for the majority of other-regarding individuals to mimic
	the minority's behavior. Likewise, a minority of other-regarding
	individuals can generate a "cooperative" aggregate outcome if their
	behavior generates incentives for a majority of self-regarding people
	to behave cooperatively. Similarly, in strategic games, aggregate
	outcomes can be either far from or close to Nash equilibrium if players
	with high degrees of strategic thinking mimic or erase the effects
	of others who do very little strategic thinking. Recently developed
	theories of other-regarding preferences and bounded rationality explain
	these findings and provide better predictions of actual aggregate
	behavior than does traditional economic theory.},

	We apply this model to the evolution of social norms, an open problem
	of ubiquitous importance in social science. Extensive statistical

	norm, of which the evolutionary outcomes in different communities
	are simple by-products. This social norm induces reputation-based
	cooperative behavior, and reflects the evolutionary propensity to

	Abstract = {The appropriate description of fluctuations within the framework of
	evolutionary game theory is a fundamental unsolved problem in the
	case of finite populations. The Moran process recently introduced
	into this context in Nowak, [Nature (London) 428, 646 (2004)] defines
	a promising standard model of evolutionary game theory in finite
	populations for which analytical results are accessible. In this
	paper, we derive the stationary distribution of the Moran process
	population dynamics for arbitrary 2 x 2 games for the finite-size
	case. We show that a nonvanishing background fitness can be transformed
	to the vanishing case by rescaling the payoff matrix. In contrast
	to the common approach to mimic finite-size fluctuations by Gaussian
	distributed noise, the finite-size fluctuations can deviate significantly
	from a Gaussian distribution.},

	explanations of biodiversity such as niche differentiation, density-dependent

	explain diversity in communities of macrobial organisms such as higher
	plants and animals. For a long time the often high diversity among
	microscopic organisms in seemingly uniform environments, the famous
	"paradox of the plankton," has been difficult to understand. The
	biodiversity in bacterial communities has been shown to be sometimes
	orders of magnitudes higher than the diversity of known macrobial
	systems. Based on a spatially explicit game theoretical model with
	multiply cyclic dominance structures, we suggest that antibiotic

	Abstract = {A mathematical model, based on the local interaction simulation approach,
	is developed in order to allow simulations of the spatiotemporal
	evolution of neoplasies. The model consists of a set of rules, which
	govern the interaction of cancerous cells among themselves and in
	competition with other cell populations for the acquisition of essential
	nutrients. As a result of small variations in the basic parameters,
	it leads to four different outcomes: indefinite growth, metastasis,
	latency, and complete regression. In the present contribution a detailed
	analysis of the dormant phase is carried on and the critical parameters
	for the transition to other phases are computed. Interesting chaotic
	behaviors can also be observed, with different attractors in the
	parameters space. Interest in the latency phase has been aroused
	by therapeutical strategies aiming to reduce a growing tumor to dormancy.
	The effect of such strategies may be simulated with our approach.},

	Abstract = {Understanding speciation is a fundamental biological problem. It is
	believed that many species originated through allopatric divergence,
	where new species arise from geographically isolated populations
	of the same ancestral species. In contrast, the possibility of sympatric
	speciation (in which new species arise without geographical isolation)
	has often been dismissed, partly because of theoretical difficulties.
	Most previous models analysing sympatric speciation concentrated
	on particular aspects of the problem while neglecting others. Here
	we present a model that integrates a novel combination of different
	features and show that sympatric speciation is a likely outcome of
	competition for resources. We use multilocus genetics to describe
	sexual reproduction in an individual-based model, and we consider
	the evolution of assortative mating (where individuals mate preferentially
	with like individuals) depending either on an ecological character
	affecting resource use or on a selectively neutral marker trait.
	In both cases, evolution of assortative mating often leads to reproductive
	isolation between ecologically diverging subpopulations. When assortative
	mating depends on a marker trait, and is therefore not directly linked
	to resource competition, speciation occurs when genetic drift breaks
	the linkage equilibrium between the marker and the ecological trait.
	Our theory conforms well with mounting empirical evidence for the
	sympatric origin of many species.},

	Abstract = {Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is an acquired hematopoietic stem
	cell (HSC) disorder characterized by the partial or complete deficiency
	of glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked membrane proteins,
	which leads to intravascular hemolysis. A loss of function mutation
	in the PIG-A gene, required for GPI biosynthesis, explains how the
	deficiency of many membrane proteins can result from a single genetic
	event. However, to date the mechanism of expansion of the GPI(-)
	clone has not been fully understood. Two hypotheses have been proposed:
	A selective advantage of GPI(-) cells because of a second mutation
	or a conditional growth advantage of GPI(-) cells in the presence
	of an immune attack on normal (GPI(+)) HSCs. Here, we explore a third
	possibility, whereby the PNH clone does not have a selective advantage.
	Simulations in a large virtual population accurately reproduce the
	known incidence of the disease; and the fit is optimized when the
	number of stem cells is decreased, reflecting a component of bone
	marrow failure in PNH. The model also accounts for the occurrence
	of spontaneous cure in PNH, consequent on clonal extinction. Thus,
	a clonal advantage may not be always necessary to explain clonal
	expansion in PNH.},

	Abstract = {High-dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (HDT-ASCT)
	have significantly improved survival in multiple myeloma (MM). However,
	patients are not cured, responses are variable and only about 40%
	of patients achieve a complete response (CR). Optimal timing of the
	procedure and knowledge of the relapse kinetics may assist physicians
	when they consider this therapeutic modality for their patients.
	We analyzed myeloma tumor burden and kinetics before and after HDT-ASCT
	in a cohort of 265 patients. Disease burden was estimated from serial
	M-spike measurements and the data fitted to the Gompertz function
	to determine the general parameters for all patients. Functions that
	couple disease burden and kinetics with time to progression (TTP)
	were derived and used to determine the optimal timing of transplantation.
	Patients who achieve CR with the first episode of HDT-ASCT should
	not be routinely offered tandem transplantation but carefully monitored
	and transplanted at an optimal disease burden. If CR is not achieved
	with a first trial of HDT-ASCT, the probability of CR after a tandem
	second trial is approximately 10%. TTP after tandem transplants (with
	its higher associated mortality) cannot be superior to TTP achieved

	We conclude that in the absence of genomic instability, acquired

	an inhibitor of abl tyrosine kinase used in the treatment of chronic
	myeloid leukemia, on type 2 diabetes. METHODS: The centralized pharmacy
	database was used to identify all patients who had received imatinib
	at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, during a 5-year period.
	The electronic medical records were subsequently reviewed to identify
	which of these patients had type 2 diabetes. In addition, relevant
	biochemical data, prior to, during, and after imatinib treatment,
	were abstracted from the electronic laboratory database and medical
	records. RESULTS: At the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, a total
	of 164 patients received imatinib during the period of study (1999
	to 2004). Of these 164 patients, 7 had preexisting type 2 diabetes,
	and diabetes developed in 2 patients during treatment with imatinib.
	Despite 2 previous reports of improvement in glycemic control with
	use of imatinib in patients with type 2 diabetes, no net effect on
	glycemic control or diabetes therapy was noted in our study cohort.
	CONCLUSION: On the basis of our current study, it seems unlikely
	that imatinib substantially affects glycemic control in patients
	with type 2 diabetes.},

	has been modeled since the 1960s, but the large amount of attention
	from both empirical and theoretical biologists that adaptive speciation
	has received in recent years goes far beyond what was described in
	Gavrilets' paper. Due to conceptual advances based on the theory
	of adaptive dynamics, adaptive speciation has emerged as a theoretically
	plausible evolutionary process that can occur in many different ecological

	Many models have been studied on the basis of the assumption that
	benefits of cooperative acts only accrue to others. Here, we analyze
	the continuous snowdrift game, in which cooperative investments are
	costly but yield benefits to others as well as to the cooperator.
	Adaptive dynamics of investment levels often result in evolutionary
	diversification from initially uniform populations to a stable state
	in which cooperators making large investments coexist with defectors
	who invest very little. Thus, when individuals benefit from their
	own actions, large asymmetries in cooperative investments can evolve.},

	Abstract = {Rates of spontaneous mutation per genome as measured in the laboratory
	are remarkably similar within broad groups of organisms but differ
	strikingly among groups. Mutation rates in RNA viruses, whose genomes
	contain ca. 10(4) bases, are roughly 1 per genome per replication
	for lytic viruses and roughly 0.1 per genome per replication for
	retroviruses and a retrotransposon. Mutation rates in microbes with
	DNA-based chromosomes are close to 1/300 per genome per replication;
	in this group, therefore, rates per base pair vary inversely and
	hugely as genome sizes vary from 6 x 10(3) to 4 x 10(7) bases or
	base pairs. Mutation rates in higher eukaryotes are roughly 0.1-100
	per genome per sexual generation but are currently indistinguishable
	from 1/300 per cell division per effective genome (which excludes
	the fraction of the genome in which most mutations are neutral).
	It is now possible to specify some of the evolutionary forces that
	shape these diverse mutation rates.},

@article{dreber:2008lr,
	Abstract = {A key aspect of human behaviour is cooperation. We tend to help others
	even if costs are involved. We are more likely to help when the costs
	are small and the benefits for the other person significant. Cooperation
	leads to a tension between what is best for the individual and what
	is best for the group. A group does better if everyone cooperates,
	but each individual is tempted to defect. Recently there has been
	much interest in exploring the effect of costly punishment on human
	cooperation. Costly punishment means paying a cost for another individual
	to incur a cost. It has been suggested that costly punishment promotes
	cooperation even in non-repeated games and without any possibility
	of reputation effects. But most of our interactions are repeated
	and reputation is always at stake. Thus, if costly punishment is
	important in promoting cooperation, it must do so in a repeated setting.
	We have performed experiments in which, in each round of a repeated
	game, people choose between cooperation, defection and costly punishment.
	In control experiments, people could only cooperate or defect. Here
	we show that the option of costly punishment increases the amount
	of cooperation but not the average payoff of the group. Furthermore,
	there is a strong negative correlation between total payoff and use
	of costly punishment. Those people who gain the highest total payoff
	tend not to use costly punishment: winners don't punish. This suggests
	that costly punishment behaviour is maladaptive in cooperation games
	and might have evolved for other reasons.},

@article{eizaguirre:2009bf,
	Abstract = {Speciation and the maintenance of recently diverged species has been
	subject of intense research in evolutionary biology for decades.
	Although the concept of ecological speciation has been accepted,
	its mechanisms and genetic bases are still under investigation. Here,
	we present a mechanism for speciation that is orchestrated and strengthened
	by parasite communities acting on polymorphic genes of the immune
	system. In vertebrates, these genes have a pleiotropic role with
	regard to parasite resistance and mate choice. In contrasting niches,
	parasite communities differ and thus the pools of alleles of the
	adapted major histocompatibility complex (MHC) also differ between
	niches. Mate choice for the best-adapted MHC genotype will favour
	local adaptations and will accelerate separation of both populations:
	thus immune genes act as pleiotropic speciation genes--'magic traits'.
	This mechanism should operate not only in sympatric populations but
	also under allopatry or parapatry. Each individual has a small subset
	of the many MHC alleles present in the population. If all individuals
	could have all MHC alleles from the pool, MHC-based adaptation is
	neither necessary nor possible. However, the typically small optimal
	individual number of MHC loci thus enables MHC-based speciation.
	Furthermore, we propose a new mechanism selecting against species
	hybrids. Hybrids are expected to have super-optimal individual MHC
	diversity and should therefore suffer more from parasites in all
	habitats.},

	Abstract = {Polymorphic genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are
	regarded as essential genes for individual fitness under conditions
	of natural and sexual selection. To test this hypothesis, we investigated
	the ultimate individual fitness trait--that of reproductive success.
	We used three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) in seminatural
	enclosures, located in natural breeding areas where the experimental
	fish had been caught. During their reproductive period, fish were
	exposed continuously to their natural sympatric parasites. By genotyping
	almost 4000 eggs with nine microsatellites, we determined parenthood
	and inferred female mating decision. We found that with reference
	to their own MHC profile, female sticklebacks preferred to mate with
	males sharing an intermediate MHC diversity. In addition, males with
	a specific MHC haplotype were bigger and better at fighting a common
	parasite (Gyrodactylus sp.). This translated directly into Darwinian
	fitness since fish harbouring this specific MHC haplotype were more
	likely to be chosen and had a higher reproductive output. We conclude
	that females also based their mating decision on a specific MHC haplotype
	conferring resistance against a common parasite. This identifies
	and supports 'good genes'. We argue that such an interaction between
	host and parasite driving assortative mating is not only a prerequisite
	for negative frequency-dependent selection--a potential mechanism
	to explain the maintenance of MHC polymorphism, but also potentially
	speciation.},

@article{Fehr:2008oz,
	Abstract = {Human social interaction is strongly shaped by other-regarding preferences,
	that is, a concern for the welfare of others. These preferences are
	important for a unique aspect of human sociality-large scale cooperation
	with genetic strangers-but little is known about their developmental
	roots. Here we show that young children's other-regarding preferences
	assume a particular form, inequality aversion that develops strongly
	between the ages of 3 and 8. At age 3-4, the overwhelming majority
	of children behave selfishly, whereas most children at age 7-8 prefer
	resource allocations that remove advantageous or disadvantageous
	inequality. Moreover, inequality aversion is strongly shaped by parochialism,
	a preference for favouring the members of one's own social group.
	These results indicate that human egalitarianism and parochialism

	Abstract = {Strong reciprocity is characterized by the willingness to altruistically
	reward cooperative acts and to altruistically punish norm-violating,
	defecting behaviours. Recent evidence suggests that subtle reputation
	cues, such as eyes staring at subjects during their choices, may
	enhance prosocial behaviour. Thus, in principle, strong reciprocity
	could also be affected by eye cues. We investigate the impact of
	eye cues on trustees' altruistic behaviour in a trust game and find
	zero effect. Neither the subjects who are classified as prosocial
	nor the subjects who are classified as selfish respond to these cues.
	In sharp contrast to the irrelevance of subtle reputation cues for
	strong reciprocity, we find a large effect of explicit, pecuniary
	reputation incentives on the trustees' prosociality. Trustees who
	can acquire a good reputation that benefits them in future interactions
	honour trust much more than trustees who cannot build a good reputation.
	These results cast doubt on hypotheses suggesting that strong reciprocity
	is easily malleable by implicit reputation cues not backed by explicit

	can theoretically evolve without help ever being exchanged among
	genetically similar individuals. Using our simple framework, we also

	by analyzing the evolutionary (replicator) dynamics of the prisoner's
	dilemma, a two-player game with two available strategies, defection
	and cooperation, whose payoff matrix favors defection. We show that,
	asymptotically, the population is partitioned into three subsets:
	individuals that always cooperate (pure cooperators), always defect
	(pure defectors), and those that intermittently change their strategy.
	In fact, the size of the later set is the biggest for a wide range
	of the "stimulus to defect" parameter. While in homogeneous random
	graphs pure cooperators are grouped into several clusters, in heterogeneous
	scale-free (SF) networks they always form a single cluster containing
	the most connected individuals (hubs). Our results give further insights
	into why cooperation in SF networks is enhanced.},

	Abstract = {One of the current theoretical challenges to the explanatory powers
	of Evolutionary Theory is the understanding of the observed evolutionary
	survival of cooperative behavior when selfish actions provide higher
	fitness (reproductive success). In unstructured populations natural
	selection drives cooperation to extinction. However, when individuals
	are allowed to interact only with their neighbors, specified by a
	graph of social contacts, cooperation-promoting mechanisms (known
	as lattice reciprocity) offer to cooperation the opportunity of evolutionary
	survival. Recent numerical works on the evolution of Prisoner's Dilemma
	in complex network settings have revealed that graph heterogeneity
	dramatically enhances the lattice reciprocity. Here we show that
	in highly heterogeneous populations, under the graph analog of replicator
	dynamics, the fixation of a strategy in the whole population is in
	general an impossible event, for there is an asymptotic partition
	of the population in three subsets, two in which fixation of cooperation
	or defection has been reached and a third one which experiences cycles
	of invasion by the competing strategies. We show how the dynamical
	partition correlates with connectivity classes and characterize the
	temporal fluctuations of the fluctuating set, unveiling the mechanisms
	stabilizing cooperation in macroscopic scale-free structures.},

	Abstract = {Understanding the proximate and ultimate sources of human cooperation
	is a fundamental issue in all behavioural sciences. In this paper,
	we review the experimental evidence on how people solve cooperation
	problems. Existing studies show without doubt that direct and indirect
	reciprocity are important determinants of successful cooperation.
	We also discuss the insights from a large literature on the role
	of peer punishment in sustaining cooperation. The experiments demonstrate
	that many people are 'strong reciprocators' who are willing to cooperate
	and punish others even if there are no gains from future cooperation
	or any other reputational gains. We document this in new one-shot
	experiments, which we conducted in four cities in Russia and Switzerland.
	Our cross-cultural approach allows us furthermore to investigate
	how the cultural background influences strong reciprocity. Our results
	show that culture has a strong influence on positive and in especially
	strong negative reciprocity. In particular, we find large cross-cultural
	differences in 'antisocial punishment' of pro-social cooperators.
	Further cross-cultural research and experiments involving different
	socio-demographic groups document that the antisocial punishment
	is much more widespread than previously assumed. Understanding antisocial
	punishment is an important task for future research because antisocial
	punishment is a strong inhibitor of cooperation.},

	cooperation but that the costs of punishment outweigh the gains from
	cooperation. This challenges evolutionary models of altruistic cooperation
	and punishment, which predict that punishment will be beneficial.
	We compared 10- and 50-period cooperation experiments. With the longer

	Abstract = {The collared lemming in the high-Arctic tundra in Greenland is preyed
	upon by four species of predators that show marked differences in
	the numbers of lemmings each consumes and in the dependence of their
	dynamics on lemming density. A predator prey model based on the field-estimated
	predator responses robustly predicts 4-year periodicity in lemming
	dynamics, in agreement with long-term empirical data. There is no
	indication in the field that food or space limits lemming population
	growth, nor is there need in the model to consider those factors.
	The cyclic dynamics are driven by a 1-year delay in the numerical
	response of the stoat and stabilized by strongly density-dependent
	predation by the arctic fox, the snowy owl, and the long-tailed skua.},

	Abstract = {Understanding the fundamental patterns and determinants of human cooperation
	and the maintenance of social order in human societies is a challenge
	across disciplines. The existing empirical evidence for the higher
	levels of cooperation when altruistic punishment is present versus
	when it is absent systematically ignores the institutional competition
	inherent in human societies. Whether punishment would be deliberately
	adopted and would similarly enhance cooperation when directly competing
	with nonpunishment institutions is highly controversial in light
	of recent findings on the detrimental effects of punishment. We show
	experimentally that a sanctioning institution is the undisputed winner
	in a competition with a sanction-free institution. Despite initial
	aversion, the entire population migrates successively to the sanctioning
	institution and strongly cooperates, whereas the sanction-free society
	becomes fully depopulated. The findings demonstrate the competitive
	advantage of sanctioning institutions and exemplify the emergence
	and manifestation of social order driven by institutional selection.},

	Abstract = {The notion of fundamental clusters is introduced, serving as a rule
	of thumb to characterize the statistical properties of the complex
	behaviour of cellular automata such as spatial 2 x 2 games. They
	represent the smallest cluster size determining the fate of the entire
	system. Checking simple growth criteria allows us to decide whether
	the cluster-individuals, e.g. some mutant family, are capable of
	surviving and invading a resident population. In biology, spatial
	2 x 2 games have a broad spectrum of applications ranging from the
	evolution of cooperation and intraspecies competition to disease
	spread. This methodological study allows simple classifications and
	long-term predictions in various biological and social models to
	be made. For minimal neighbourhood types, we show that the intuitive
	candidate, a 3 x 3 cluster, turns out to be fundamental with certain
	weak limitations for the Moore neighbourhood but not for the Von
	Neumann neighbourhood. However, in the latter case, 2 x 2 clusters
	generally serve as reliable indicators to whether a strategy survives.
	Stochasticity is added to investigate the effects of varying fractions
	of one strategy present at initialization time and to discuss the
	rich dynamic properties in greater detail. Finally, we derive Liapunov
	exponents for the system and show that chaos reigns in a small region
	where the two strategies coexist in dynamical equilibrium.},

	Abstract = {The public goods game represents a straightforward generalization
	of the prisoner's dilemma to an arbitrary number of players. Since
	the dominant strategy is to defect, both classical and evolutionary
	game theory predict the asocial outcome that no player contributes
	to the public goods. In contrast to the compulsory public goods game,
	optional participation provides a natural way to avoid deadlocks
	in the state of mutual defection. The three resulting strategies--collaboration
	or defection in the public goods game, as well as not joining at
	all--are studied by means of a replicator dynamics, which can be
	completely analysed in spite of the fact that the payoff terms are
	nonlinear. If cooperation is valuable enough, the dynamics exhibits
	a rock-scissors-paper type of cycling between the three strategies,
	leading to sizeable average levels of cooperation in the population.
	Thus, voluntary participation makes cooperation feasible. But for
	each strategy, the average payoff value remains equal to the earnings
	of those not participating in the public goods game.},

	Abstract = {Understanding the emergence of cooperation is a fundamental problem
	in evolutionary biology. Evolutionary game theory has become a powerful
	framework with which to investigate this problem. Two simple games
	have attracted most attention in theoretical and experimental studies:
	the Prisoner's Dilemma and the snowdrift game (also known as the
	hawk-dove or chicken game). In the Prisoner's Dilemma, the non-cooperative
	state is evolutionarily stable, which has inspired numerous investigations
	of suitable extensions that enable cooperative behaviour to persist.
	In particular, on the basis of spatial extensions of the Prisoner's
	Dilemma, it is widely accepted that spatial structure promotes the
	evolution of cooperation. Here we show that no such general predictions
	can be made for the effects of spatial structure in the snowdrift
	game. In unstructured snowdrift games, intermediate levels of cooperation
	persist. Unexpectedly, spatial structure reduces the proportion of
	cooperators for a wide range of parameters. In particular, spatial
	structure eliminates cooperation if the cost-to-benefit ratio of
	cooperation is high. Our results caution against the common belief
	that spatial structure is necessarily beneficial for cooperative
	behaviour.},

	Abstract = {The emergence and maintenance of cooperation by natural selection
	is an enduring conundrum in evolutionary biology, which has been
	studied using a variety of game theoretical models inspired by different
	biological situations. The most widely studied games are the Prisoner's
	Dilemma, the Snowdrift game and by-product mutualism for pairwise
	interactions, as well as Public Goods games in larger groups of interacting
	individuals. Here, we present a general framework for cooperation
	in social dilemmas in which all the traditional scenarios can be
	recovered as special cases. In social dilemmas, cooperators provide
	a benefit to the group at some cost, while defectors exploit the
	group by reaping the benefits without bearing the costs of cooperation.
	Using the concepts of discounting and synergy for describing how
	benefits accumulate when more than one cooperator is present in a
	group of interacting individuals, we recover the four basic scenarios
	of evolutionary dynamics given by (i) dominating defection, (ii)
	coexistence of defectors and cooperators, (iii) dominating cooperation
	and (iv) bi-stability, in which cooperators and defectors cannot
	invade each other. Generically, for groups of three or more interacting
	individuals further, more complex, dynamics can occur. Our framework
	provides the first unifying approach to model cooperation in different

	enables the strategy to adjust its decisions to the character of
	the current opponent and to adapt the most promising strategic behavior.
	For this reason, we call such strategies Adaptor. Through evolutionary

	Abstract = {According to Thomas Hobbes' Leviathan {$[$}1651; 2008 (Touchstone,
	New York), English Ed], "the life of man [is] solitary, poor, nasty,
	brutish, and short," and it would need powerful social institutions
	to establish social order. In reality, however, social cooperation
	can also arise spontaneously, based on local interactions rather
	than centralized control. The self-organization of cooperative behavior
	is particularly puzzling for social dilemmas related to sharing natural
	resources or creating common goods. Such situations are often described
	by the prisoner's dilemma. Here, we report the sudden outbreak of
	predominant cooperation in a noisy world dominated by selfishness
	and defection, when individuals imitate superior strategies and show
	success-driven migration. In our model, individuals are unrelated,
	and do not inherit behavioral traits. They defect or cooperate selfishly
	when the opportunity arises, and they do not know how often they
	will interact or have interacted with someone else. Moreover, our
	individuals have no reputation mechanism to form friendship networks,
	nor do they have the option of voluntary interaction or costly punishment.
	Therefore, the outbreak of prevailing cooperation, when directed
	motion is integrated in a game-theoretical model, is remarkable,
	particularly when random strategy mutations and random relocations
	challenge the formation and survival of cooperative clusters. Our
	results suggest that mobility is significant for the evolution of
	social order, and essential for its stabilization and maintenance.},

	Abstract = {Recent behavioral experiments aimed at understanding the evolutionary
	foundations of human cooperation have suggested that a willingness
	to engage in costly punishment, even in one-shot situations, may
	be part of human psychology and a key element in understanding our
	sociality. However, because most experiments have been confined to
	students in industrialized societies, generalizations of these insights
	to the species have necessarily been tentative. Here, experimental
	results from 15 diverse populations show that (i) all populations
	demonstrate some willingness to administer costly punishment as unequal
	behavior increases, (ii) the magnitude of this punishment varies
	substantially across populations, and (iii) costly punishment positively
	covaries with altruistic behavior across populations. These findings
	are consistent with models of the gene-culture coevolution of human
	altruism and further sharpen what any theory of human cooperation
	needs to explain.},

	rules is introduced. The emergent properties are studied through
	two complementary approaches. One is based on a heuristic local analysis,
	the other on exact global techniques. \\ The local analysis provides
	criteria to group games into classes with distinct behavior. The
	results facilitate numerical simulations and reveal that even simple
	games allow for complex spatio-temporal phenomena. The global analysis
	demonstrates that certain games perform an uphill march in a fitness
	landscape determined by the payoff parameters and the topology of
	the underlying lattice structure. For generic game parameters, the
	landscape is rugged owing to competing interactions and generates
	dynamical phenomena well known from frustrated systems: trapping
	in local maxima for noiseless dynamics and very long relaxation times
	for stochastic dynamics. \\ Although the model is a mere caricature
	of evolutionary processes, some of its emergent properties are reminiscent
	of those observed in nature. It is argued that similar dynamical
	phenomena will be presenr in more elaborate approaches.},

	Abstract = {The main obstacle for the evolution of cooperation is that natural
	selection favors defection in most settings. In the repeated prisoner's
	dilemma, two individuals interact several times, and, in each round,
	they have a choice between cooperation and defection. We analyze
	the evolutionary dynamics of three simple strategies for the repeated
	prisoner's dilemma: always defect (ALLD), always cooperate (ALLC),
	and tit-for-tat (TFT). We study mutation-selection dynamics in finite
	populations. Despite ALLD being the only strict Nash equilibrium,
	we observe evolutionary oscillations among all three strategies.
	The population cycles from ALLD to TFT to ALLC and back to ALLD.
	Most surprisingly, the time average of these oscillations can be
	entirely concentrated on TFT. In contrast to the classical expectation,
	which is informed by deterministic evolutionary game theory of infinitely
	large populations, stochastic evolution of finite populations need
	not choose the strict Nash equilibrium and can therefore favor cooperation
	over defection.},

	few, if any, selective events to transform a highly invasive cancer

	of cell culture ex vivo does not introduce new clonal mutations into

	Abstract = {There are currently few therapeutic options for patients with pancreatic
	cancer, and new insights into the pathogenesis of this lethal disease
	are urgently needed. Toward this end, we performed a comprehensive
	genetic analysis of 24 pancreatic cancers. We first determined the
	sequences of 23,219 transcripts, representing 20,661 protein-coding
	genes, in these samples. Then, we searched for homozygous deletions
	and amplifications in the tumor DNA by using microarrays containing
	probes for approximately 10(6) single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We
	found that pancreatic cancers contain an average of 63 genetic alterations,
	the majority of which are point mutations. These alterations defined
	a core set of 12 cellular signaling pathways and processes that were
	each genetically altered in 67 to 100% of the tumors. Analysis of
	these tumors' transcriptomes with next-generation sequencing-by-synthesis
	technologies provided independent evidence for the importance of
	these pathways and processes. Our data indicate that genetically
	altered core pathways and regulatory processes only become evident
	once the coding regions of the genome are analyzed in depth. Dysregulation
	of these core pathways and processes through mutation can explain
	the major features of pancreatic tumorigenesis.},

	Abstract = {The extent to which a population diverges from its ancestor through
	adaptive evolution depends on variation supplied by novel beneficial
	mutations. Extending earlier work, recent theory makes two predictions
	that seem to be robust to biological details: the distribution of
	fitness effects among beneficial mutations before selection should
	be (i) exponential and (ii) invariant, meaning it is always exponential
	regardless of the fitness rank of the wild-type allele. Here we test
	these predictions by assaying the fitness of 665 independently derived
	single-step mutations in the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens across
	a range of environments. We show that the distribution of fitness
	effects among beneficial mutations is indistinguishable from an exponential
	despite marked variation in the fitness rank of the wild type across
	environments. These results suggest that the initial step in adaptive
	evolution--the production of novel beneficial mutants from which
	selection sorts--is very general, being characterized by an approximately
	exponential distribution with many mutations of small effect and
	few of large effect. We also document substantial variation in the
	pleiotropic costs of antibiotic resistance, a result that may have
	implications for strategies aimed at eliminating resistant pathogens
	in animal and human populations.},

@article{Kelly:2007aa,
	Abstract = {Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an acquired clonal disorder
	of hemopoietic stem cells (HSC) that is characterized by intravascular
	hemolysis and venous thrombosis. The PNH HSC's (and their progeny)
	have a somatic mutation of the X-linked phosphatidylinositol glycan
	class A gene (PIG-A) which causes a complete or partial deficiency
	of glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchored proteins, which in turn
	produces the symptoms of the disease. PIG-A mutations account for
	all of classical acquired PNH cases thus far reported as a single
	acquired PIG-A mutation on the only active X-chromosome results in
	GPI-deficiency. A novel mutation in the promoter of the phosphatidylinositol
	glycan class M gene (PIG-M) has recently been reported in two unrelated
	families exhibiting autosomal recessive inheritance of congenital
	GPI-deficiency. This point mutation reduces PIG-M transcription and
	causes partial deficiency of GPI-anchored proteins. It is possible
	that this point mutation in PIG-M occurs at low frequency in the
	population but predisposes to mutation of the other PIG-M allele
	and could result in acquired PNH. To determine the prevalence of
	the PIG-M in classical acquired PNH the PIG-M promoter region spanning
	the proposed mutation was sequenced to look for heterozygotes with
	the C [-&gt;] G substitution at position 270. This mutation was not
	identified in 36 patients with PNH. There is convincing evidence
	that GPI-deficient HSC's have no intrinsic proliferative advantage
	over normal HSC's suggesting that other factors underlie the clonal
	expansion of PNH cells. The most likely explanation appears to be
	due to factors which are extrinsic to the PNH clone such as immune
	attack on normal HSC. Recently secondary molecular events within
	the PNH clone have been suggested to provide the growth advantage
	allowing expansion of the PNH clone. One such proposed event is a
	translocation affecting the HMGA2 gene, which has been described
	in 2 cases of PNH. HMGA2 is a member of the high motility group of
	proteins and acts as an architectural transcription factor. HMGA2
	proteins are associated with gene activation and are mainly expressed
	during embryonic development. Rearrangements of HMGA2 commonly occur
	in benign mesenchymal tumours, but have also been identified as infrequent
	events in myeloid malignancies. To gain insight into the potential
	role of HMGA2 deregulation in the pathogenesis of PNH we evaluated
	the expression of HMGA2 mRNA by means of quantitative RT-PCR in peripheral
	blood samples of 42 PNH patients (median age: 42, range: 1881) and
	ten normal controls. All PNH samples had large granulocyte clones
	(median size 97.81%) but showed no increase in HMGA2 mRNA. In nine
	of the 42 PNH patients blood samples underwent additional enrichment
	for CD15 positive cells to maximize the proportion of PNH granulocytes
	present. This again showed no aberrant expression of HMGA2 mRNA.
	This is the largest reported group with PNH evaluated for HMGA2 expression.
	Despite two case reports suggesting that the deregulation of HMGA2
	may be a pathophysiological factor in occasional cases of PNH our
	data indicates that this mechanism accounts for the growth advantage
	of PNH cells in, at most, only a small minority of patients. Similarly,
	the PIG-M promoter mutation observed in congenital GPI-deficiency
	was not found in any of our patients with classical acquired PNH
	indicating that it has no or little role in the pathophysiology of
	PNH.},

	Abstract = {Much of the work on extinction events has focused on external perturbations
	of ecosystems, such as climatic change, or anthropogenic factors.
	Extinction, however, can also be driven by endogenous factors, such
	as the ecological interactions between species in an ecosystem. Here
	we show that endogenously driven extinction events can have a scale-free
	distribution in simple spatially structured host-parasitoid systems.
	Due to the properties of this distribution there may be many such
	simple ecosystems that, although not strictly permanent, persist
	for arbitrarily long periods of time. We identify a critical phase
	transition in the parameter space of the host-parasitoid systems,
	and explain how this is related to the scale-free nature of the extinction
	process. Based on these results, we conjecture that scale-free extinction
	processes and critical phase transitions of the type we have found
	may be a characteristic feature of many spatially structured, multi-species
	ecosystems in nature. The necessary ingredient appears to be competition
	between species where the locally inferior type disperses faster
	in space. If this condition is satisfied then the eventual outcome
	depends subtly on the strength of local superiority of one species
	versus the dispersal rate of the other.},

	Abstract = {Explaining the evolution of cooperation among non-relatives is one
	of the major challenges for evolutionary biology. In this study,
	we experimentally examined human cooperation in the iterated Snowdrift
	game (ISD), which has received little attention so far, and compared
	it with human cooperation in the iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD),
	which has become the paradigm for the evolution of cooperation. We
	show that iteration in the ISD leads to consistently higher levels
	of cooperation than in the IPD. We further demonstrate that the most
	successful strategies known for the IPD (generous Tit-for-Tat and
	Pavlov) were also successfully used in the ISD. Interestingly, we
	found that female players cooperated significantly more often than
	male players in the IPD but not in the ISD. Moreover, female players
	in the IPD applied Tit-for-Tat-like or Pavlovian strategies significantly
	more often than male players, thereby achieving significantly higher
	pay-offs than male players did. These data demonstrate that the willingness
	to cooperate does not only depend on the type of the social dilemma,
	but also on the class of individuals involved. Altogether, our study
	shows that the ISD can potentially explain high levels of cooperation
	among non-relatives in humans. In addition, the ISD seems to reflect
	the social dilemma more realistically than the IPD because individuals
	obtain immediate direct benefits from the cooperative acts they perform
	and costs of cooperation are shared between cooperators.},

	Abstract = {Evolutionary graph theory has been proposed as providing new fundamental
	rules for the evolution of co-operation and altruism. But how do
	these results relate to those of inclusive fitness theory? Here,
	we carry out a retrospective analysis of the models for the evolution
	of helping on graphs of Ohtsuki et al. [Nature (2006) 441, 502] and
	Ohtsuki & Nowak [Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B Biol. Sci (2006) 273,
	2249]. We show that it is possible to translate evolutionary graph
	theory models into classical kin selection models without disturbing
	at all the mathematics describing the net effect of selection on
	helping. Model analysis further demonstrates that costly helping
	evolves on graphs through limited dispersal and overlapping generations.
	These two factors are well known to promote relatedness between interacting
	individuals in spatially structured populations. By allowing more
	than one individual to live at each node of the graph and by allowing
	interactions to vary with the distance between nodes, our inclusive
	fitness model allows us to consider a wider range of biological scenarios
	leading to the evolution of both helping and harming behaviours on
	graphs.},

	those of size j, that is, K(ai;aj)similar to a(lambda)K(i;j), the
	mean aggregate size grows with time as t(1/(2-lambda)) for lambda<2.
	The aggregate size distribution exhibits distinct regimes of behavior
	that are controlled by the scaling properties of the migration rate
	from the smallest to the largest aggregates. Our theory applies to
	diverse phenomena such as the distribution of city populations, late
	stage coarsening of nonsymmetric binary systems, and models for wealth

	Abstract = {Evolutionary dynamics have been traditionally studied in the context
	of homogeneous or spatially extended populations. Here we generalize
	population structure by arranging individuals on a graph. Each vertex
	represents an individual. The weighted edges denote reproductive
	rates which govern how often individuals place offspring into adjacent
	vertices. The homogeneous population, described by the Moran process,
	is the special case of a fully connected graph with evenly weighted
	edges. Spatial structures are described by graphs where vertices
	are connected with their nearest neighbours. We also explore evolution
	on random and scale-free networks. We determine the fixation probability
	of mutants, and characterize those graphs for which fixation behaviour
	is identical to that of a homogeneous population. Furthermore, some
	graphs act as suppressors and others as amplifiers of selection.
	It is even possible to find graphs that guarantee the fixation of
	any advantageous mutant. We also study frequency-dependent selection
	and show that the outcome of evolutionary games can depend entirely
	on the structure of the underlying graph. Evolutionary graph theory
	has many fascinating applications ranging from ecology to multi-cellular
	organization and economics.},

	Abstract = {We present a Bayesian dynamical inference method for characterizing
	cardiorespiratory (CR) dynamics in humans by inverse modeling from
	blood pressure time-series data. The technique is applicable to a
	broad range of stochastic dynamical models and can be implemented
	without severe computational demands. A simple nonlinear dynamical
	model is found that describes a measured blood pressure time series
	in the primary frequency band of the CR dynamics. The accuracy of
	the method is investigated using model-generated data with parameters
	close to the parameters inferred in the experiment. The connection
	of the inferred model to a well-known beat-to-beat model of the baroreflex
	is discussed.},

@article{macy:2002hc,
	Abstract = {The Nash equilibrium, the main solution concept in analytical game
	theory, cannot make precise predictions about the outcome of repeated
	mixed-motive games. Nor can it tell us much about the dynamics by
	which a population of players moves from one equilibrium to another.
	These limitations, along with concerns about the cognitive demands
	of forward-looking rationality, have motivated efforts to explore
	backward-looking alternatives to analytical game theory. Most of
	the effort has been invested in evolutionary models of population
	dynamics. We shift attention to a learning-theoretic alternative.
	Computational experiments with adaptive agents identify a fundamental
	solution concept for social dilemmas--stochastic collusion--based
	on a random walk from a self-limiting noncooperative equilibrium
	into a self-reinforcing cooperative equilibrium. However, we show
	that this solution is viable only within a narrow range of aspiration
	levels. Below the lower threshold, agents are pulled into a deficient
	equilibrium that is a stronger attractor than mutual cooperation.
	Above the upper threshold, agents are dissatisfied with mutual cooperation.
	Aspirations that adapt with experience (producing habituation to
	stimuli) do not gravitate into the window of viability; rather, they
	are the worst of both worlds. Habituation destabilizes cooperation
	and stabilizes defection. Results from the two-person problem suggest
	that applications to multiplex and embedded relationships will yield
	unexpected insights into the global dynamics of cooperation in social
	dilemmas.},

	Abstract = {The clinical success of the ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib
	in chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) serves as a model for molecularly
	targeted therapy of cancer, but at least two critical questions remain.
	Can imatinib eradicate leukaemic stem cells? What are the dynamics
	of relapse due to imatinib resistance, which is caused by mutations
	in the ABL kinase domain? The precise understanding of how imatinib
	exerts its therapeutic effect in CML and the ability to measure disease
	burden by quantitative polymerase chain reaction provide an opportunity
	to develop a mathematical approach. We find that a four-compartment
	model, based on the known biology of haematopoietic differentiation,
	can explain the kinetics of the molecular response to imatinib in
	a 169-patient data set. Successful therapy leads to a biphasic exponential
	decline of leukaemic cells. The first slope of 0.05 per day represents
	the turnover rate of differentiated leukaemic cells, while the second
	slope of 0.008 per day represents the turnover rate of leukaemic
	progenitors. The model suggests that imatinib is a potent inhibitor
	of the production of differentiated leukaemic cells, but does not
	deplete leukaemic stem cells. We calculate the probability of developing
	imatinib resistance mutations and estimate the time until detection
	of resistance. Our model provides the first quantitative insights
	into the in vivo kinetics of a human cancer.},

	a game called the Prisoner's Dilemma in which selfish defection is
	always more rewarding than cooperation. If the two protagonists have
	a certain minimum probability of meeting again a strategy called
	TIT FOR TAT is very successful. In TIT FOR TAT the player cooperates
	on the first move and thereafter does whatever the opponent did on
	the previous move. I have studied the behaviour of fish when confronting
	a potential predator, because conflicts can arise within pairs of
	fish in these circumstances which I argue resemble a series of games
	of Prisoner's Dilemma. Using a system of mirrors, single three-spined
	sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) approaching a live predator
	were provided with either a simulated cooperating companion or a
	simulated defecting one. In both cases the test fish behaved according
	to TIT FOR TAT supporting the hypothesis that cooperation can evolve

	Abstract = {Sexual selection has been proposed as one mechanism to explain the
	maintenance of high allelic diversity in MHC genes that control the
	extent of resistance against pathogens and parasites in natural populations.
	MHC-based sexual selection is known to involve olfactory mechanisms
	in fish, mice, and humans. During mate choice, females of the three-spined
	stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) use an odor-based selection
	strategy to achieve an optimal level of MHC diversity in their offspring,
	equipping them with optimal resistance toward pathogens and parasites.
	The molecular mechanism of odor-based mate-selection strategies is
	unknown. Because peptide ligands for MHC class I molecules function
	as individuality signals in mice, we hypothesized that female sticklebacks
	might assess the degree of MHC diversity of potential partners by
	means of the structural diversity of the corresponding peptide ligands
	in perceived odor signals. We show that structurally diverse MHC
	ligands interact with natural odors of male sticklebacks to predictably
	modify MHC-related mate choice. For a mating pair with suboptimal
	numbers of MHC alleles, peptides increase the attractiveness of male
	water, whereas for a mating pair with superoptimal numbers, attractiveness
	is decreased. Our results suggest that female sticklebacks use evolutionarily
	conserved structural features of MHC peptide ligands to evaluate
	MHC diversity of their prospective mating partners.},

	Abstract = {Theorists have only recently shown that cooperation through indirect
	reciprocity can evolve. The first modelling approach favoured a mechanism
	called image scoring. Helping someone increases one's image score,
	whereas refusing to help reduces it. The evolutionary outcome was
	a discriminator image scoring strategy that helps everybody who has,
	for example, a positive image score. Two experimental studies with
	humans found results that were compatible with discriminator image
	scoring. However, a new analysis of other theorists, based on another
	population structure, has cast doubts on the evolutionary stability
	of strategies using the recipient's score as a sole basis for decision.
	The new theoretical study confirmed that a strategy aiming at "good
	standing" has superior properties and easily beats image scoring.
	An individual loses good standing by failing to help a recipient
	in good standing, whereas failing to help recipients who lack good
	standing does not damage the standing of a potential donor (but would
	reduce his image score). The present empirical study with 23 groups
	of seven human subjects each was designed for distinguishing between
	the two proposed mechanisms experimentally. The results differed
	strongly from standing strategies, which might demand too much working
	memory capacity, but were compatible with image scoring or a similar
	strategy to a large extent. Furthermore, donors of constant "NO players"
	compensated for their refusing to help these players by being more
	generous to others.},

	Abstract = {Will a group of people reach a collective target through individual
	contributions when everyone suffers individually if the target is
	missed? This "collective-risk social dilemma" exists in various social
	scenarios, the globally most challenging one being the prevention
	of dangerous climate change. Reaching the collective target requires
	individual sacrifice, with benefits to all but no guarantee that
	others will also contribute. It even seems tempting to contribute
	less and save money to induce others to contribute more, hence the
	dilemma and the risk of failure. Here, we introduce the collective-risk
	social dilemma and simulate it in a controlled experiment: Will a
	group of people reach a fixed target sum through successive monetary
	contributions, when they know they will lose all their remaining
	money with a certain probability if they fail to reach the target
	sum? We find that, under high risk of simulated dangerous climate
	change, half of the groups succeed in reaching the target sum, whereas
	the others only marginally fail. When the risk of loss is only as
	high as the necessary average investment or even lower, the groups
	generally fail to reach the target sum. We conclude that one possible
	strategy to relieve the collective-risk dilemma in high-risk situations
	is to convince people that failure to invest enough is very likely
	to cause grave financial loss to the individual. Our analysis describes
	the social window humankind has to prevent dangerous climate change.},

@article{milinski:1998zp,
	Abstract = {Many problems in human society reflect the inability of selfish parties
	to cooperate. The "Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma" has been used widely
	as a model for the evolution of cooperation in societies. Axelrod's
	computer tournaments and the extensive simulations of evolution by
	Nowak and Sigmund and others have shown that natural selection can
	favor cooperative strategies in the Prisoner's Dilemma. Rigorous
	empirical tests, however, lag behind the progress made by theorists.
	Clear predictions differ depending on the players' capacity to remember
	previous rounds of the game. To test whether humans use the kind
	of cooperative strategies predicted, we asked students to play the
	iterated Prisoner's Dilemma game either continuously or interrupted
	after each round by a secondary memory task (i.e., playing the game
	"Memory") that constrained the students' working-memory capacity.
	When playing without interruption, most students used "Pavlovian"
	strategies, as predicted, for greater memory capacity, and the rest
	used "generous tit-for-tat" strategies. The proportion of generous
	tit-for-tat strategies increased when games of Memory interfered
	with the subjects' working memory, as predicted. Students who continued
	to use complex Pavlovian strategies were less successful in the Memory
	game, but more successful in the Prisoner's Dilemma, which indicates
	a trade-off in memory capacity for the two tasks. Our results suggest
	that the set of strategies predicted by game theorists approximates
	human reality.},

@article{Noji:2007aa,
	Abstract = {Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an acquired hematological
	disorder, in which almost all hematopoietic cells lack glycosylphosphatidylinositol
	(GPI)-anchored proteins due to phosphatidylinositol glycan-class
	A (PIG-A) gene abnormalities at the level of hematopoietic stem cells.
	It has been reported that several minor PNH clones in patients with
	aplastic anemia and myelodysplastic syndromes occur at random during
	the clinical course (Okamoto M et al, Leukemia, 2006), while one
	or more major PNH clones in patients with typical PNH continue to
	exist during their clinical courses (Nishimura J et al, Blood, 2002).
	To clarify how PNH clones in patients with PNH expand during their
	clinical courses, we examined sequence analyses of the PIG-A gene
	using peripheral blood granulocytes from PNH patients with high (>10%;
	n=5) and low (<10%; n=3) proportions of CD16 or CD59 granulocytes,
	which were determined by flow cytometry using CD16b or CD59 monoclonal
	antibody, respectively. A patient with over 1% of CD59 erythrocytes
	was judged to have PNH erythrocytes (Shichishima T et al, Br J Haematol,
	1993). PNH clones were defined as GPI-negative hematopoietic cells
	with PIG-A mutations. Twenty to 40 bacterial clones of PCR or RT-PCR
	products of the PIG-A gene with GPI-negative or unsorted populations
	of peripheral blood granulocytes were analyzed by nucleotide sequencing.
	We examined sequence analyses of the PIG-A gene in peripheral blood
	granulocytes at least twice during the clinical course (the period
	of 19952007). Major PNH clones were decided by the Chi2 test or the
	Fisher's exact probability test. In all of 5 PNH patients with high
	proportions of PNH clones, major PNH clones were found at least once
	and were common during their clinical courses. However, the PNH clones
	in 3 of 5 PNH patients were transiently major during their clinical
	courses. In 2 of 3 PNH patients with low proportions of PNH clones,
	there were common PIG-A mutations during their clinical courses,
	but were not major clones. The PNH clone from one of the 2 PNH patients
	acquired a new PIG-A mutation, which was also minor. Another patient
	of the 3 patients with low proportions of PNH clones had a major
	PNH clone at the time of the first examination, but disappeared at
	the time of the next analysis. In conclusion, our findings suggest
	that the clonality of PNH clones in PNH patients with high and low
	proportions of PNH clones could change during their clinical courses
	and that especially, the clonality of PNH clones in PNH patients
	with low proportions of PNH clones is not necessarily definitive.

@article{ohtsuki:2004ah,
	Abstract = {Theory of indirect reciprocity is important in explaining cooperation
	between humans. Since a partner of a social interaction often changes,
	an individual should assess his partner by using social information
	such as reputation and make decisions whether to help him or not.
	To those who have 'good' social reputation does a player give aid
	as reciprocation, whereas he has to refuse to help those who have
	'bad' reputation. Otherwise benefits of altruism is easily exploited
	by them. Little has been known, however, about the definition of
	'goodness' in reputation. What kind of actions are and should be
	regarded as good and what kind of actions bad? And what sort of goodness
	enables sustaining exchange of altruism? We herein challenge this
	question with an evolutionary perspective. We generalize social reputation
	as 'Honor-score' (H-score) and examine the conditions under which
	individuals in a group stably maintain cooperative relationships
	based on indirect reciprocity. We examine the condition for evolutionarily
	stable strategies (ESSs) over 4096 possible cases exhaustively. Mathematical
	analysis reveals that only eight cases called 'leading eight' are
	crucial to the evolution of indirect reciprocity. Each in the leading
	eight shares two common characteristics: (i) cooperation with good
	persons is regarded as good while defection against them is regarded
	as bad, and (ii) defection against bad persons should be regarded
	as a good behavior because it works as sanction. Our results give
	one solution to the definition of goodness from an evolutionary viewpoint.
	In addition, we believe that the formalism of reputation dynamics
	gives general insights into the way social information is generated,
	handled, and transmitted in animal societies.},

	Abstract = {Traditional evolutionary game theory explores frequency-dependent
	selection in well-mixed populations without spatial or stochastic
	effects. But recently there has been much interest in studying the
	evolutionary game dynamics in spatial settings, on lattices and other
	graphs. Here, we present an analytic approach for the stochastic
	evolutionary game dynamics on the simplest possible graph, the cycle.
	For three different update rules, called 'birth-death' (BD), 'death-birth'
	(DB) and 'imitation' (IM), we derive exact conditions for natural
	selection to favour one strategy over another. As specific examples,
	we consider a coordination game and Prisoner's Dilemma. In the latter
	case, selection can favour cooperators over defectors for DB and
	IM updating. We also study the case where the replacement graph of
	evolutionary updating remains a cycle, but the interaction graph
	for playing the game is a complete graph. In this setting, all three
	update rules lead to identical conditions in the limit of weak selection,
	where we find the '1/3-law' of well-mixed populations.},

	Abstract = {The Santa Fe Artificial Market consists of a central computational
	market and a number of artificially-intelligent agents. The agents
	choose between investing in a stock or leaving their money in the
	bank, which pays a fixed interest rate. The stock pays a stochastic
	dividend and has a price which fluctuates according to agent demand.
	The agents make their investment decisions by attempting to forecast
	the future return on the stock, using genetic algorithms to generate,
	test, and evolve predictive rules. \\ The artificial market shows
	two distinct regimes of behavior, depending on parameter settings
	and initial conditions. One regime corresponds to the theoretically-predicted
	rational expectations behavior, with low overall trading volume,
	uncorrelated price series, and no possibility of technical trading.
	The other regime is more complex and corresponds to realistic market
	behavior, with high trading volume, hight intermittend volatility
	(including GARCH behavior), bubbles and crashes, and the presence
	of technical trading. One parameter that can be used to control the
	regime is the exploration rate, which governs how rapidly the agents
	explore new hypothesis with their genetic algorithms. At low exploration
	rate the market settles into the rational expectations equilibrium.
	At high exploration rate it falls into the more realistic complex
	regime. The transition is fairly sharp, but close to the boundary
	the outcome depends on the agent's initial "'beliefs"{} -- if they
	believe in rational expectations it occurs, and is a local attractor;
	otherwise the market evolves into the complex regime.},

	Abstract = {Indirect reciprocity occurs when the cooperative behavior between
	two individuals is contingent on their previous behavior toward others.
	Previous theoretical analysis indicates that indirect reciprocity
	can evolve if individuals use an image-scoring strategy. In this
	paper, we show that, when errors are added, indirect reciprocity
	cannot be based on an image-scoring strategy. However, if individuals
	use a standing strategy, then cooperation through indirect reciprocity
	is evolutionarily stable. These two strategies differ with respect
	to the information to which they attend. While image-scoring strategies
	only need attend to the actions of others, standing strategies also
	require information about intent. We speculate that this difference
	may shed light on the evolvability of indirect reciprocity. Additionally,
	we show that systems of indirect reciprocity are highly sensitive
	to the availability of information. Finally, we present a model which

	Abstract = {Cyclic dominance of three species is a commonly occurring interaction
	dynamics, often denoted the rock-paper-scissors (RPS) game. Such
	a type of interactions is known to promote species coexistence. Here,
	we generalize recent results of Reichenbach [Nature (London) 448,
	1046 (2007)] of a four-state variant of the RPS game. We show that
	spiral formation takes place only without a conservation law for
	the total density. Nevertheless, in general, fast diffusion can destroy
	species coexistence. We also generalize the four-state model to slightly
	varying reaction rates. This is shown both analytically and numerically
	not to change pattern formation, or the effective wavelength of the
	spirals, and therefore not to alter the qualitative properties of
	the crossover to extinction.},

	dilemma game on a square lattice where a fraction of players mu can
	spread their strategy more easily than the rest due to a predetermined
	larger teaching capability. In addition, players characterized by
	the larger teaching capability are allowed to temporarily link with
	distant opponents of the same kind with probability p , thus introducing
	shortcut connections among the distinguished players. We show that
	these additional temporary connections are able to sustain cooperation
	throughout the whole range of the temptation to defect. Remarkably,
	we observe that, as the temptation to defect increases the optimal
	mu decreases, and moreover only minute values of p warrant the best
	promotion of cooperation. Our study thus indicates that influential
	individuals must be few and sparsely connected in order for cooperation
	to thrive in a defection-prone environment.},

	Abstract = {The way cooperation organizes dynamically strongly depends on the
	topology of the underlying interaction network. We study this dependence
	using heterogeneous scale-free networks with different levels of
	(a) degree-degree correlations and (b) enhanced clustering, where
	the number of neighbors of connected nodes are correlated and the
	number of closed triangles are enhanced, respectively. Using these
	networks, we analyze a finite population analog of the evolutionary
	replicator dynamics of the prisoner's dilemma, the latter being a
	two-player game with two strategies, defection and cooperation, whose
	payoff matrix favors defection. Both topological features significantly
	change the dynamics with respect to the one observed for fully randomized
	scale-free networks and can strongly facilitate cooperation even
	for a large temptation to defect, and should hence be considered
	as important factors in the evolution and sustainment of cooperation.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evolution involves both deterministic and random processes,
	both of which are known to contribute to directional evolutionary
	change. A number of studies have shown that when fitness is treated
	as a random variable, meaning that each individual has a distribution
	of possible fitness values, then both the mean and variance of individual
	fitness distributions contribute to directional evolution. Unfortunately
	the most general mathematical description of evolution that we have,
	the Price equation, is derived under the assumption that both fitness
	and offspring phenotype are fixed values that are known exactly.
	The Price equation is thus poorly equipped to study an important
	class of evolutionary processes. RESULTS: I present a general equation
	for directional evolutionary change that incorporates both deterministic
	and stochastic processes and applies to any evolving system. This
	is essentially a stochastic version of the Price equation, but it
	is derived independently and contains terms with no analog in Price's
	formulation. This equation shows that the effects of selection are
	actually amplified by random variation in fitness. It also generalizes
	the known tendency of populations to be pulled towards phenotypes
	with minimum variance in fitness, and shows that this is matched
	by a tendency to be pulled towards phenotypes with maximum positive
	asymmetry in fitness. This equation also contains a term, having
	no analog in the Price equation, that captures cases in which the
	fitness of parents has a direct effect on the phenotype of their
	offspring. CONCLUSION: Directional evolution is influenced by the
	entire distribution of individual fitness, not just the mean and
	variance. Though all moments of individuals' fitness distributions
	contribute to evolutionary change, the ways that they do so follow
	some general rules. These rules are invisible to the Price equation
	because it describes evolution retrospectively. An equally general
	prospective evolution equation compliments the Price equation and
	shows that the influence of stochastic processes on directional evolution
	is more diverse than has generally been recognized.},

	Abstract = {With the advent of dense maps of human genetic variation, it is now
	possible to detect positive natural selection across the human genome.
	Here we report an analysis of over 3 million polymorphisms from the
	International HapMap Project Phase 2 (HapMap2). We used 'long-range
	haplotype' methods, which were developed to identify alleles segregating
	in a population that have undergone recent selection, and we also
	developed new methods that are based on cross-population comparisons
	to discover alleles that have swept to near-fixation within a population.
	The analysis reveals more than 300 strong candidate regions. Focusing
	on the strongest 22 regions, we develop a heuristic for scrutinizing
	these regions to identify candidate targets of selection. In a complementary
	analysis, we identify 26 non-synonymous, coding, single nucleotide
	polymorphisms showing regional evidence of positive selection. Examination
	of these candidates highlights three cases in which two genes in
	a common biological process have apparently undergone positive selection
	in the same population:LARGE and DMD, both related to infection by
	the Lassa virus, in West Africa;SLC24A5 and SLC45A2, both involved
	in skin pigmentation, in Europe; and EDAR and EDA2R, both involved
	in development of hair follicles, in Asia.},

	with the traditional homogeneous setting used in studies of evolutionary

	studying games on graphs, in which the variability in connectivity
	ranges from single-scale graphs, for which heterogeneity is small
	and associated degree distributions exhibit a Gaussian tale, to scale-free
	graphs, for which heterogeneity is large with degree distributions
	exhibiting a power-law behavior. We study the evolution of cooperation,
	modeled in terms of the most popular dilemmas of cooperation. We
	show that, for all dilemmas, increasing heterogeneity favors the
	emergence of cooperation, such that long-term cooperative behavior
	easily resists short-term noncooperative behavior. Moreover, we show
	how cooperation depends on the intricate ties between individuals

	Furthermore, we use at profit the remarkable similarity between the

	of Watts-Strogatz to assess the separate roles of heterogeneity and
	small-world effects. We investigate the dependence on these two mechanisms
	of the threshold for epidemic outbreaks and also of the coevolution
	of cooperators and defectors under natural selection. With respect
	to the well-studied regular homogeneous limits, we find a subtle
	interplay between these mechanisms. While they both contribute to
	reduce the threshold for an epidemic outburst, they exhibit opposite

	Abstract = {Humans often cooperate in public goods games and situations ranging
	from family issues to global warming. However, evolutionary game
	theory predicts that the temptation to forgo the public good mostly
	wins over collective cooperative action, and this is often also seen
	in economic experiments. Here we show how social diversity provides
	an escape from this apparent paradox. Up to now, individuals have
	been treated as equivalent in all respects, in sharp contrast with
	real-life situations, where diversity is ubiquitous. We introduce
	social diversity by means of heterogeneous graphs and show that cooperation
	is promoted by the diversity associated with the number and size
	of the public goods game in which each individual participates and
	with the individual contribution to each such game. When social ties
	follow a scale-free distribution, cooperation is enhanced whenever
	all individuals are expected to contribute a fixed amount irrespective
	of the plethora of public goods games in which they engage. Our results
	may help to explain the emergence of cooperation in the absence of
	mechanisms based on individual reputation and punishment. Combining
	social diversity with reputation and punishment will provide instrumental
	clues on the self-organization of social communities and their economical
	implications.},

	Abstract = {Collective efforts are a trademark of both insect and human societies.
	They are achieved through relatedness in the former and unknown mechanisms
	in the latter. The problem of achieving cooperation among non-kin
	has been described as the 'tragedy of the commons', prophesying the
	inescapable collapse of many human enterprises. In public goods experiments,
	initial cooperation usually drops quickly to almost zero. It can
	be maintained by the opportunity to punish defectors or the need
	to maintain good reputation. Both schemes require that defectors
	are identified. Theorists propose that a simple but effective mechanism
	operates under full anonymity. With optional participation in the
	public goods game, 'loners' (players who do not join the group),
	defectors and cooperators will coexist through rock-paper-scissors
	dynamics. Here we show experimentally that volunteering generates
	these dynamics in public goods games and that manipulating initial
	conditions can produce each predicted direction. If, by manipulating
	displayed decisions, it is pretended that defectors have the highest
	frequency, loners soon become most frequent, as do cooperators after
	loners and defectors after cooperators. On average, cooperation is
	perpetuated at a substantial level.},

	Abstract = {Altruism presents a challenge to evolutionary theory because selection
	should favor selfish over caring strategies. Greenbeard altruism
	resolves this paradox by allowing cooperators to identify individuals
	carrying similar alleles producing a form of genic selection. In
	side-blotched lizards, genetically similar but unrelated blue male
	morphs settle on adjacent territories and cooperate. Here we show
	that payoffs of cooperation depend on asymmetric costs of orange
	neighbors. One blue male experiences low fitness and buffers his
	unrelated partner from aggressive orange males despite the potential
	benefits of defection. We show that recognition behavior is highly
	heritable in nature, and we map genetic factors underlying color
	and self-recognition behavior of genetic similarity in both sexes.
	Recognition and cooperation arise from genome-wide factors based
	on our mapping study of the location of genes responsible for self-recognition
	behavior, recognition of blue color, and the color locus. Our results
	provide an example of greenbeard interactions in a vertebrate that
	are typified by cycles of greenbeard mutualism interspersed with
	phases of transient true altruism. Such cycles provide a mechanism
	encouraging the origin and stability of true altruism.},

	Abstract = {The elucidation of the human genome sequence has made it possible
	to identify genetic alterations in cancers in unprecedented detail.
	To begin a systematic analysis of such alterations, we determined
	the sequence of well-annotated human protein-coding genes in two
	common tumor types. Analysis of 13,023 genes in 11 breast and 11
	colorectal cancers revealed that individual tumors accumulate an
	average of approximately 90 mutant genes but that only a subset of
	these contribute to the neoplastic process. Using stringent criteria
	to delineate this subset, we identified 189 genes (average of 11
	per tumor) that were mutated at significant frequency. The vast majority
	of these genes were not known to be genetically altered in tumors
	and are predicted to affect a wide range of cellular functions, including
	transcription, adhesion, and invasion. These data define the genetic
	landscape of two human cancer types, provide new targets for diagnostic
	and therapeutic intervention, and open fertile avenues for basic
	research in tumor biology.},

	Abstract = {Communication about social topics is abundant in human societies,
	and many functions have been attributed to such gossiping. One of
	these proposed functions is the management of reputations. Reputation
	by itself has been shown to have a strong influence on cooperation
	dynamics in games of indirect reciprocity, and this notion helps
	to explain the observed high level of cooperation in humans. Here
	we designed a game to test a widespread assumption that gossip functions
	as a vector for the transmission of social information. This empirical
	study (with 14 groups of nine students each) focuses on the composition
	of gossip, information transfer by gossip, and the behavior based
	on gossip information. We show that gossip has a strong influence
	on the resulting behavior even when participants have access to the
	original information (i.e., direct observation) as well as gossip
	about the same information. Thus, it is evident that gossip has a
	strong manipulative potential. Furthermore, gossip about cooperative
	individuals is more positive than gossip about uncooperative individuals,
	gossip comments transmit social information successfully, and cooperation
	levels are higher when people encounter positive compared with negative
	gossip.},

	the species exchange their sites with a probability X . For low X
	values, a self-organizing pattern is maintained by cyclic invasions.
	If X exceeds a threshold value, then two types of domain grow up

	Abstract = {Simple combinations of common competitive mechanisms can easily result
	in cyclic competitive dominance relationships between species. The
	topological features of such competitive networks allow for complex
	spatial coexistence patterns. We investigate self-organization and
	coexistence in a lattice model, describing the spatial population
	dynamics of competing bacterial strains. With increasing diffusion
	rate the community of the nine possible toxicity/resistance types
	undergoes two phase transitions. Below a critical level of diffusion,
	the system exhibits expanding domains of three different defensive
	alliances, each consisting of three cyclically dominant species.
	Due to the neutral relationship between these alliances and the finite
	system size effect, ultimately only one of them remains. At large
	diffusion rates the system admits three coexisting domains, each
	containing mutually neutral species. Because of the cyclical dominance
	between these domains, a long term stable coexistence of all species
	is ensured. In the third phase at intermediate diffusion the spatial
	structure becomes even more complicated with domains of mutually
	neutral species persisting along the borders of defensive alliances.
	The study reveals that cyclic competitive relationships may produce
	a large variety of complex coexistence patterns, exhibiting common
	features of natural ecosystems, like hierarchical organization, phase
	transitions and sudden, large-scale fluctuations.},

	Abstract = {Voluntary participation in public good games has recently been demonstrated
	to be a simple yet effective mechanism to avoid deadlocks in states
	of mutual defection and to promote persistent cooperative behavior.
	Apart from cooperators and defectors a third strategical type is
	considered: the risk averse loners who are unwilling to participate
	in the social enterprise and rather rely on small but fixed earnings.
	This results in a rock-scissors-paper type of cyclic dominance of
	the three strategies. In the prisoner's dilemma, the effects of voluntary
	participation crucially depend on the underlying population structure.
	While leading to homogeneous states of all loners in well-mixed populations,
	we demonstrate that cyclic dominance produces self-organizing patterns
	on square lattices but leads to different types of oscillatory behavior
	on random regular graphs: the temptation to defect determines whether
	damped, periodic, or increasing oscillations occur. These Monte Carlo
	simulations are complemented by predictions from pair approximation
	reproducing the results for random regular graphs particularly well.},

	Abstract = {Evolutionary dynamics are strongly affected by population structure.
	The outcome of an evolutionary process in a well-mixed population
	can be very different from that in a structured population. We introduce
	a powerful method to study dynamical population structure: evolutionary
	set theory. The individuals of a population are distributed over
	sets. Individuals interact with others who are in the same set. Any
	2 individuals can have several sets in common. Some sets can be empty,
	whereas others have many members. Interactions occur in terms of
	an evolutionary game. The payoff of the game is interpreted as fitness.
	Both the strategy and the set memberships change under evolutionary
	updating. Therefore, the population structure itself is a consequence
	of evolutionary dynamics. We construct a general mathematical approach
	for studying any evolutionary game in set structured populations.
	As a particular example, we study the evolution of cooperation and
	derive precise conditions for cooperators to be selected over defectors.},

@article{tarnita:2009jx,
	Abstract = {Evolutionary game theory studies frequency dependent selection. The
	fitness of a strategy is not constant, but depends on the relative
	frequencies of strategies in the population. This type of evolutionary
	dynamics occurs in many settings of ecology, infectious disease dynamics,
	animal behavior and social interactions of humans. Traditionally
	evolutionary game dynamics are studied in well-mixed populations,
	where the interaction between any two individuals is equally likely.
	There have also been several approaches to study evolutionary games
	in structured populations. In this paper we present a simple result
	that holds for a large variety of population structures. We consider
	the game between two strategies, A and B, described by the payoff
	matrix [Formula: see text]. We study a mutation and selection process.
	For weak selection strategy A is favored over B if and only if sigma
	a+b>c+sigma d. This means the effect of population structure on strategy
	selection can be described by a single parameter, sigma. We present
	the values of sigma for various examples including the well-mixed
	population, games on graphs, games in phenotype space and games on
	sets. We give a proof for the existence of such a sigma, which holds
	for all population structures and update rules that have certain
	(natural) properties. We assume weak selection, but allow any mutation
	rate. We discuss the relationship between sigma and the critical
	benefit to cost ratio for the evolution of cooperation. The single
	parameter, sigma, allows us to quantify the ability of a population
	structure to promote the evolution of cooperation or to choose efficient
	equilibria in coordination games.},

	Abstract = {The methods of inclusive fitness provide a powerful analysis of the
	action of selection on social behaviour. The key component of this
	analysis is the concept of relatedness R. In infinite populations,
	a standard method of calculating relatedness coefficients is through
	coefficients of consanguinity using the notion of genetic identity
	by descent. In this paper, we show that this approach can also be
	made to work in finite populations and we assume here that the population
	has a homogeneous structure, such as an island model. We demonstrate
	that, under the assumption that genetic effects are small and additive,
	the resulting formulation of inclusive fitness is equivalent to other
	significant measures of selection in finite populations, including
	the change in average allele frequency and fixation probability.
	The results are illustrated for a model of the evolution of cooperation
	in a finite island population.},

	Abstract = {Evolutionary game theory is a general mathematical framework that
	describes the evolution of social traits. This framework forms the
	basis of many multilevel selection models and is also frequently
	used to model evolutionary dynamics on networks. Kin selection, which
	was initially restricted to describe social interactions between
	relatives, has also led to a broader mathematical approach, inclusive
	fitness, that can not only describe social evolution among relatives,
	but also in group structured populations or on social networks. It
	turns out that the underlying mathematics of game theory is fundamentally
	different from the approach of inclusive fitness. Thus, both approaches-evolutionary
	game theory and inclusive fitness-can be helpful to understand the
	evolution of social traits in group structured or spatially extended

	Abstract = {We analyze a cooperative game, where the cooperative act is not based
	on the previous behavior of the coplayer, but on the similarity between
	the players. This system has been studied in a mean-field description
	recently [Phys. Rev. E 68, 046129 (2003)]]. Here, the spatial extension
	to a two-dimensional lattice is studied, where each player interacts
	with eight players in a Moore neighborhood. The system shows a strong
	segregation independent of parameters. The introduction of a local
	conversion mechanism towards tolerance allows for four-state cycles
	and the emergence of spiral waves in the spatial game. In the case
	of asymmetric costs of cooperation a rich variety of complex behavior
	is observed depending on both cooperation costs. Finally, we study
	the stabilization of a cooperative fixed point of a forecast rule
	in the symmetric game, which corresponds to cooperation across segregation
	borders. This fixed point becomes unstable for high cooperation costs,
	but can be stabilized by a linear feedback mechanism.},

	Abstract = {Evolutionary game theory describes systems where individual success
	is based on the interaction with others. We consider a system in
	which players unconditionally imitate more successful strategies
	but sometimes also explore the available strategies at random. Most
	research has focused on how strategies spread via genetic reproduction
	or cultural imitation, but random exploration of the available set
	of strategies has received less attention so far. In genetic settings,
	the latter corresponds to mutations in the DNA, whereas in cultural
	evolution, it describes individuals experimenting with new behaviors.
	Genetic mutations typically occur with very small probabilities,
	but random exploration of available strategies in behavioral experiments
	is common. We term this phenomenon "exploration dynamics" to contrast
	it with the traditional focus on imitation. As an illustrative example
	of the emerging evolutionary dynamics, we consider a public goods
	game with cooperators and defectors and add punishers and the option
	to abstain from the enterprise in further scenarios. For small mutation
	rates, cooperation (and punishment) is possible only if interactions
	are voluntary, whereas moderate mutation rates can lead to high levels
	of cooperation even in compulsory public goods games. This phenomenon
	is investigated through numerical simulations and analytical approximations.},

	Abstract = {Recently, Riolo et al. [Nature (London) 414, 441 (2001)] showed by
	computer simulations that cooperation can arise without reciprocity
	when agents donate only to partners who are sufficiently similar
	to themselves. One striking outcome of their simulations was the
	observation that the number of tolerant agents that support a wide
	range of players was not constant in time, but showed characteristic
	fluctuations. The cause and robustness of these tides of tolerance
	remained to be explored. Here we clarify the situation by solving
	a minimal version of the model of Riolo et al. It allows us to identify
	a net surplus of random changes from intolerant to tolerant agents
	as a necessary mechanism that produces these oscillations of tolerance,
	which segregate different agents in time. This provides a new mechanism
	for maintaining different agents, i.e., for creating biodiversity.
	In our model the transition to the oscillating state is caused by
	a saddle node bifurcation. The frequency of the oscillations increases
	linearly with the transition rate from tolerant to intolerant agents.},

@article{trivers:1976mb,
	Abstract = {Halminton (1) was apparently the first to appreciate that the synthesis
	of Mendelian genetics with Darwin's theory of natural selection had
	profound implications for social theory. In particular, insofar as
	almost all social behavior is either selfish or altruistic (or has
	such effects), genetical reasoning suggests that an individual's
	social behavior should be adjusted to his or her degree of relatedness,
	r, to all individuals affected by the behavior. We call this theory
	kinship theory. The social insects provide a critical test of Hamilton's
	kinship theory. When such theory is combined with the sex ratio theory
	of Fisher (9), a body of consistent predictions emerges regarding
	the haplodiploid Hymenoptera. The evolution of female workers helping
	their mother reproduce is more likely in the Hymenoptera than in
	diploid groups, provided that such workers lay some of the male-producing
	eggs or bias the ratio of investment toward reproductive females.
	Once eusocial colonies appear, certain biases by sex in these colonies
	are expected to evolve. In general, but especially in eusocial ants,
	the ratio of investment should be biased in favor of females, and
	in it is expected to equilibrate at 1 : 3 (male to female). We present
	evidence from 20 species that the ratio of investment in monogynous
	ants is, indeed, about 1 : 3, and we subject this discovery to a
	series of tests. As expected, the slave-making ants produce a ratio
	of investment of 1 : 1, polygynoys ants produce many more males than
	expected on the basis of relative dry weight alone, solitary bees
	and wasps produce a ratio of investment near 1 : 1 (and no greater
	than 1 : 2), and the social bumblebees produce ratios of investment
	between 1 : 1 and 1 : 3. In addition, sex ratios in monogynous ants
	and in trapnested wasps are, as predicted by Fisher, inversely related
	to the relative cost in these species of producing a male instead
	of a female. Taken together, these data provide quantitative evidence
	in support of kinship theory, sex ratio theory, the assumption that
	the offspring is capable of acting counter to its parents' best interests,
	and the supposition that haplodiploidy has played a unique role in
	the evolution of the social insects. Finally, we outline a theory
	for the evolution of worker-queen conflict, a theory which explains
	the queen's advantage in competition over male-producing workers
	and the workers' advantage regarding the ratio of investment. The
	theory uses the asymmetries of haplodiploidy to explain how the evolved
	outcome of parent-offspring conflict in the social Hymenoptera is
	expected to be a function of certain social and life history parameters.},

@article{van-segbroeck:2008px,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: In recent years it has been found that the combination
	of evolutionary game theory with population structures modelled in
	terms of dynamical graphs, in which individuals are allowed to sever
	unwanted social ties while keeping the good ones, provides a viable
	solution to the conundrum of cooperation. It is well known that in
	reality individuals respond differently to disadvantageous interactions.
	Yet, the evolutionary mechanism determining the individuals' willingness
	to sever unfavourable ties remains unclear. RESULTS: We introduce
	a novel way of thinking about the joint evolution of cooperation
	and social contacts. The struggle for survival between cooperators
	and defectors leads to an arms race for swiftness in adjusting social
	ties, based purely on a self-regarding, individual judgement. Since
	defectors are never able to establish social ties under mutual agreement,
	they break adverse ties more rapidly than cooperators, who tend to
	evolve stable and long-term relations. Ironically, defectors' constant
	search for partners to exploit leads to heterogeneous networks that
	improve the survivability of cooperators, compared to the traditional
	homogenous population assumption. CONCLUSION: When communities face
	the prisoner's dilemma, swift reaction to adverse ties evolves when
	competition is fierce between cooperators and defectors, providing
	an evolutionary basis for the necessity of individuals to adjust
	their social ties. Our results show how our innate resilience to
	change relates to mutual agreement between cooperators and how "loyalty"
	or persistent social ties bring along an evolutionary disadvantage,
	both from an individual and group perspective.},

	Abstract = {Group selection theory has a history of controversy. After a period
	of being in disrepute, models of group selection have regained some
	ground, but not without a renewed debate over their importance as
	a theoretical tool. In this paper I offer a simple framework for
	models of the evolution of altruism and cooperation that allows us
	to see how and to what extent both a classification with and one
	without group selection terminology are insightful ways of looking
	at the same models. Apart from this dualistic view, this paper contains
	a result that states that inclusive fitness correctly predicts the
	direction of selection for one class of models, represented by linear
	public goods games. Equally important is that this result has a flip
	side: there is a more general, but still very realistic class of
	models, including models with synergies, for which it is not possible
	to summarize their predictions on the basis of an evaluation of inclusive
	fitness.},

	Abstract = {This paper distinguishes two categories of questions that the Price
	equation can help us answer. The two different types of questions
	require two different disciplines that are related, but nonetheless
	move in opposite directions. These disciplines are probability theory
	on the one hand and statistical inference on the other. In the literature
	on the Price equation this distinction is not made. As a result of
	this, questions that require a probability model are regularly approached
	with statistical tools. In this paper, we examine the possibilities
	of the Price equation for answering questions of either type. By
	spending extra attention on mathematical formalities, we avoid the
	two disciplines to get mixed up. After that, we look at some examples,
	both from kin selection and from group selection, that show how the
	inappropriate use of statistical terminology can put us on the wrong
	track. Statements that are 'derived' with the help of the Price equation
	are, therefore, in many cases not the answers they seem to be. Going
	through the derivations in reverse can, however, be helpful as a
	guide how to build proper (probabilistic) models that do give answers.},

	Abstract = {An evolutionary prisoner's dilemma (PD) game is studied with players
	located on a hierarchical structure of layered square lattices. The
	players can follow two strategies [ D (defector) and C (cooperator)]
	and their income comes from PD games with the "neighbors." The adoption
	of one of the neighboring strategies is allowed with a probability
	dependent on the payoff difference. Monte Carlo simulations are performed
	to study how the measure of cooperation is affected by the number
	of hierarchical levels (Q) and by the temptation to defect. According
	to the simulations the highest frequency of cooperation can be observed
	at the top level if the number of hierarchical levels is low (Q<4)
	. For larger Q , however, the highest frequency of cooperators occurs
	in the middle layers. The four-level hierarchical structure provides
	the highest average (total) income for the whole community.},

	selection at the populational level occurred despite strong individual
	selection which caused a decline in the mean size of the control

	wave solution of the system revealed; (1) Farmers can never expel
	exploiters in any traveling wave solution. (2) The expanding velocity
	of the exploiter population invading the farmer population can be
	analytically determined and it depends only on a cost of altruism
	and the diffusion coefficients while it is independent of the benefit
	of altruism. (3) When the effect of altruism is small, the dynamics

	Abstract = {The iterated Prisoner's Dilemma has become the paradigm for the evolution
	of cooperation among egoists. Since Axelrod's classic computer tournaments
	and Nowak and Sigmund's extensive simulations of evolution, we know
	that natural selection can favor cooperative strategies in the Prisoner's
	Dilemma. According to recent developments of theory the last champion
	strategy of "win--stay, lose--shift" ("Pavlov") is the winner only
	if the players act simultaneously. In the more natural situation
	of players alternating the roles of donor and recipient a strategy
	of "Generous Tit-for-Tat" wins computer simulations of short-term
	memory strategies. We show here by experiments with humans that cooperation
	dominated in both the simultaneous and the alternating Prisoner's
	Dilemma. Subjects were consistent in their strategies: 30% adopted
	a Generous Tit-for-Tat-like strategy, whereas 70% used a Pavlovian
	strategy in both the alternating and the simultaneous game. As predicted
	for unconditional strategies, Pavlovian players appeared to be more

	Abstract = {The iterated Prisoner's Dilemma has become the paradigm for the evolution
	of cooperation among egoists. Since Axelrod's classic computer tournaments
	and Nowak and Sigmund's extensive simulations of evolution, we know
	that natural selection can favor cooperative strategies in the Prisoner's
	Dilemma. According to recent developments of theory the last champion
	strategy of "win--stay, lose--shift" ("Pavlov") is the winner only
	if the players act simultaneously. In the more natural situation
	of players alternating the roles of donor and recipient a strategy
	of "Generous Tit-for-Tat" wins computer simulations of short-term
	memory strategies. We show here by experiments with humans that cooperation
	dominated in both the simultaneous and the alternating Prisoner's
	Dilemma. Subjects were consistent in their strategies: 30% adopted
	a Generous Tit-for-Tat-like strategy, whereas 70% used a Pavlovian
	strategy in both the alternating and the simultaneous game. As predicted
	for unconditional strategies, Pavlovian players appeared to be more
	successful in the simultaneous game whereas Generous Tit-for-Tat-like
	players achieved higher payoffs in the alternating game. However,
	the Pavlovian players were smarter than predicted: they suffered

@article{weinreich:2005tx,
	Abstract = {Fitness interactions between loci in the genome, or epistasis, can
	result in mutations that are individually deleterious but jointly
	beneficial. Such epistasis gives rise to multiple peaks on the genotypic
	fitness landscape. The problem of evolutionary escape from such local
	peaks has been a central problem of evolutionary genetics for at
	least 75 years. Much attention has focused on models of small populations,
	in which the sequential fixation of valley genotypes carrying individually
	deleterious mutations operates most quickly owing to genetic drift.
	However, valley genotypes can also be subject to mutation while transiently
	segregating, giving rise to copies of the high fitness escape genotype
	carrying the jointly beneficial mutations. In the absence of genetic
	recombination, these mutations may then fix simultaneously. The time
	for this process declines sharply with increasing population size,
	and it eventually comes to dominate evolutionary behavior. Here we
	develop an analytic expression for N(crit), the critical population
	size that defines the boundary between these regimes, which shows
	that both are likely to operate in nature. Frequent recombination
	may disrupt high-fitness escape genotypes produced in populations
	larger than N(crit) before they reach fixation, defining a third
	regime whose rate again slows with increasing population size. We
	develop a novel expression for this critical recombination rate,
	which shows that in large populations the simultaneous fixation of
	mutations that are beneficial only jointly is unlikely to be disrupted
	by genetic recombination if their map distance is on the order of
	the size of single genes. Thus, counterintuitively, mass selection
	alone offers a biologically realistic resolution to the problem of
	evolutionary escape from local fitness peaks in natural populations.},

	Abstract = {From an evolutionary perspective, social behaviours are those which
	have fitness consequences for both the individual that performs the
	behaviour, and another individual. Over the last 43 years, a huge
	theoretical and empirical literature has developed on this topic.
	However, progress is often hindered by poor communication between
	scientists, with different people using the same term to mean different
	things, or different terms to mean the same thing. This can obscure
	what is biologically important, and what is not. The potential for
	such semantic confusion is greatest with interdisciplinary research.
	Our aim here is to address issues of semantic confusion that have
	arisen with research on the problem of cooperation. In particular,
	we: (i) discuss confusion over the terms kin selection, mutualism,
	mutual benefit, cooperation, altruism, reciprocal altruism, weak
	altruism, altruistic punishment, strong reciprocity, group selection
	and direct fitness; (ii) emphasize the need to distinguish between
	proximate (mechanism) and ultimate (survival value) explanations

	Abstract = {Adaptation is conventionally regarded as occurring at the level of
	the individual organism, where it functions to maximize the individual's
	inclusive fitness. However, it has recently been argued that empirical
	studies on the evolution of parasite virulence in spatial populations
	show otherwise. In particular, it has been claimed that the evolution
	of lower virulence in response to limited parasite dispersal provides
	proof of Wynne-Edwards's idea of adaptation at the group level. Although
	previous theoretical work has shown that limited dispersal can favour
	lower virulence, it has not clarified why, with five different suggestions
	having been given. Here we show that the effect of dispersal on parasite
	virulence can be understood entirely within the framework of inclusive
	fitness theory. Limited parasite dispersal favours lower parasite
	growth rates and, hence, reduced virulence because it (1) decreases
	the direct benefit of producing offspring (dispersers are worth more
	than non-dispersers, because they can go to patches with no or fewer
	parasites), and (2) increases the competition for hosts experienced
	by both the focal individual ('self-shading') and their relatives
	('kin shading'). This demonstrates that reduced virulence can be
	understood as an individual-level adaptation by the parasite to maximize
	its inclusive fitness, and clarifies the links with virulence theory
	more generally.},

	is a reluctance to revisit the pivotal events that took place during

	of alternative theoretical frameworks to explain the evolution of
	cooperative and altruistic behaviors. In this article, we take a
	"back to basics" approach, explaining what group selection is, why
	its rejection was regarded as so important, and how it has been revived
	based on a more careful formulation and subsequent research. Multilevel
	selection theory (including group selection) provides an elegant
	theoretical foundation for sociobiology in the future, once its turbulent

	Abstract = {In this new assessment of the empirical evidence, an alternative to
	the standard model is proposed: group selection is the strong binding
	force in eusocial evolution; individual selection, the strong dissolutive
	force; and kin selection (narrowly defined), either a weak binding
	or weak dissolutive force, according to circumstance. Close kinship
	may be more a consequence of eusociality than a factor promoting
	its origin. A point of no return to the solitary state exists, as
	a rule when workers become anatomically differentiated. Eusociality
	has been rare in evolution, evidently due to the scarcity of environmental
	pressures adequate to tip the balance among countervailing forces
	in favor of group selection. Eusociality in ants and termites in
	the irreversible stage is the key to their ecological dominance and
	has (at least in ants) shaped some features of internal phylogeny.
	Their colonies are consistently superior to solitary and preeusocial
	competitors, due to the altruistic behavior among nestmates and their
	ability to organize coordinated action by pheromonal communication.},

	Abstract = {Evolutionary game dynamics describes how successful strategies spread
	in a population. In well-mixed populations, the usual assumption,
	e.g. underlying the replicator dynamics, is that individuals obtain
	a payoff from interactions with a representative sample of the population.
	This determines their fitness. Here, we analyze a situation in which
	payoffs are obtained through a single interaction, so that individuals
	of the same type can have different payoffs. We show analytically
	that for weak selection, this scenario is identical to the usual
	approach in which an individual interacts with the whole population.
	For strong selection, however, differences arise that are reflected
	in the fixation probabilities and lead to deviating evolutionary

	Abstract = {An adaptive immune response is usually initiated only if a major histocompatibility
	complex (MHC) molecule presents pathogen-derived peptides to T-cells.
	Every MHC molecule can present only peptides that match its peptide-binding
	groove. Thus, it seems advantageous for an individual to express
	many different MHC molecules to be able to resist many different
	pathogens. However, although MHC genes are the most polymorphic genes
	of vertebrates, each individual has only a very small subset of the
	diversity at the population level. This is an evolutionary paradox.
	We provide an overview of the current data on infection studies and
	mate-choice experiments and conclude that overall evidence suggests
	that intermediate intra-individual MHC diversity is optimal. Selective
	forces that may set an upper limit to intra-individual MHC diversity
	are discussed. An updated mathematical model based on recent findings
	on T-cell selection can predict the natural range of intra-individual
	MHC diversity. Thus, the aim of our review is to evaluate whether
	the number of MHC alleles usually present in individuals may be optimal
	to balance the advantages of presenting an increased range of peptides
	versus the disadvantages of an increased loss of T-cells.},

	Abstract = {The per-genome, per-generation rate of spontaneous mutation affecting
	fitness (U) and the mean fitness cost per mutation (s) are important
	parameters in evolutionary genetics, but have been estimated for
	few species. We estimated U and sh (the heterozygous effect of mutations)
	for two diploid yeast strains differing only in the DNA mismatch-repair
	deficiency used to elevate the mutation rate in one (mutator) strain.
	Mutations were allowed to accumulate in 50 replicate lines of each
	strain, during 36 transfers of randomly chosen single colonies (approximately
	600 generations). Among wild-type lines, fitnesses were bimodal,
	with one mode showing no change in mean fitness. The other mode showed
	a mean 29.6% fitness decline and the petite phenotype, usually caused
	by partial deletion of the mitochondrial genome. Excluding petites,
	maximum-likelihood estimates adjusted for the effect of selection
	were U = 9.5 x 10(-5) and sh = 0.217 for the wild type. Among the
	mutator lines, the best fit was obtained with 0.005 < or = U < or
	= 0.94 and 0.049 > or = sh > or = 0.0003. Like other recently tested
	model organisms, wild-type yeast have low mutation rates, with high
	mean fitness costs per mutation. Inactivation of mismatch repair
	increases the frequency of slightly deleterious mutations by approximately
	two orders of magnitude.},

	Abstract = {Stochastic evolutionary game dynamics for finite populations has recently
	been widely explored in the study of evolutionary game theory. It
	is known from the work of Traulsen et al. [2005. Phys. Rev. Lett.
	95, 238701] that the stochastic evolutionary dynamics approaches
	the deterministic replicator dynamics in the limit of large population
	size. However, sometimes the limiting behavior predicted by the stochastic
	evolutionary dynamics is not quite in agreement with the steady-state
	behavior of the replicator dynamics. This paradox inspired us to
	give reasonable explanations of the traditional concept of evolutionarily
	stable strategy (ESS) in the context of finite populations. A quasi-stationary
	analysis of the stochastic evolutionary game dynamics is put forward
	in this study and we present a new concept of quasi-stationary strategy
	(QSS) for large but finite populations. It is shown that the consistency
	between the QSS and the ESS implies that the long-term behavior of
	the replicator dynamics can be predicted by the quasi-stationary
	behavior of the stochastic dynamics. We relate the paradox to the
	time scales and find that the contradiction occurs only when the
	fixation time scale is much longer than the quasi-stationary time
	scale. Our work may shed light on understanding the relationship
	between the deterministic and stochastic methods of modeling evolutionary
	game dynamics.},
